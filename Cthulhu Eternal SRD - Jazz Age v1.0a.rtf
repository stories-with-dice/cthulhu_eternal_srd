\pard\keep\keepn\s1\sb120\sl276\slmult1\cf1\b\i0\f0\fs28 What Is \i Cthulhu Eternal?\i0\f1\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\i\fs22 Cthulhu Eternal\i0  is a tabletop roleplaying game which allows you to play out a broad range of investigative adventures in different eras of history, as tainted by the ravages of H.P. Lovecraft\rquote s Cthulhu Mythos. \par
The only assumptions made by the \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0  rules are that:\par
\pard\fi-360\li765\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f2\'b7\tab\f1 The game takes place in an era of our planet\rquote s past, present, or future where humanity is the prevailing \endash  although not necessarily only \endash  species actively shaping the world.\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 The world is haunted by secret and mysterious survivals of otherworldly or extra-dimensional forces of Lovecraft\rquote s mythos; clues to their existence are scattered through written accounts (if such exist) or folktales passed from generation-to-generation.\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 Players take on roles of everyday people from the era, without special pulp-like \ldblquote super-powers\rdblquote ; regardless of their frailty they pursue the truth about the Cthulhu Mythos and ultimately work to thwart its corrosive influence.\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 Player characters are physical human beings that can be hurt, fall unconscious, or die if subject to physical damage \endash  and conversely, they can be healed using whatever knowledge of \ldblquote first aid\rdblquote  exists in the historical era.\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 Player characters are conscious and intelligent beings whose sanity can be adversely affected by witnessing terrible things beyond normal human comprehension \endash  and conversely, they can have their mental state made better by whatever folk-remedies or medical science exists in the historical era.\par

\pard\keep\keepn\s1\sb480\sl276\slmult1\cf1\b\f0\fs28 Lovecraftian Investigations in the Jazz Age\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 This version of Cthulhu Eternal is specifically tailored to support Lovecraftian games set in the Jazz Age \endash  that is, the world as it was in the early 20\super th\nosupersub  Century (between the World Wars). This is an attractive option for a game setting \endash  and one that has been used many times \endash  for one simple reason. When H.P. Lovecraft was writing his uncanny tales of weird horror, he frequently chose to set them in the world that was most familiar to him and his readers: the present-day world at the time they were written. Given that those tales were penned between 1920 and Lovecraft\rquote s death in 1937, there are plenty of examples of original creations that take place in the inter-war era we\rquote ve termed the \ldblquote Jazz Age.\rdblquote  Those stories can easily serve as great sources of inspiration for your own scenarios \endash  and best of all they are reliably authentic to the period (because they were written by someone living through it).\par
While Lovecraft set the ball rolling on the style of weird tale we now call \ldblquote Lovecraftian\rdblquote  he was certainly not the only person who was writing contemporary horror fiction in the 1920s and 1930s with a \ldblquote cosmic\rdblquote  flavor. In fact, Lovecraft himself famously encouraged friends and correspondents to join in with his grand game of inventing this nascent sub-genre, sometimes suggesting ideas to colleagues, sometimes revising their fiction for pay. This means that there are other authors of the period whose fiction can serve as inspiration for era-authentic games. Because each writer has his or her own unique voice, tracking down works by some of these contemporaries of H.P. Lovecraft can give you a different style of \ldblquote Mythos\rdblquote  story that you can use as a starting point for your own ideas. Some writers you can search out:\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f2\'b7\tab\f1 Frank Belknap Long\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 Robert Bloch\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 Robert E. Howard\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 Henry Kuttner\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 Manly Wade Wellman\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1 Of course, there is no reason that you need to limit yourself to creating scenarios and plots inspired by those writing contemporary fiction in the 1920s or 1930s. Indeed, you can ignore those writers entirely and focus on weaving your original ideas into a compelling Jazz Age scenario or campaign. There are, however, a few pitfalls that you should try to avoid when striking out on your own:\par
\pard\fi-360\li1080\sa200\sl276\slmult1 1.\tab Social structures in the Jazz Age are typically quite different to anything we\rquote ve personally experienced,\par
2.\tab The technology of the 1920s and 1930s is simplistic by our standards (and it\rquote s easy to make assumptions that are anachronistic),\par
3.\tab People in the Jazz Age typically knew much less about the current state of the world outside their immediate vicinity: there is no instant communication of news. Indeed, there still exist some corners of the world which have not been fully explored and documented.\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1 In general, it is worth investing some time in navigating these pitfalls since a story that ignores major differences in society, technology, etc., will not feel especially genuine to the period. Depending on your players, this can spoil any chance of them feeling immersed in the unique \ldblquote feel\rdblquote  of the era. It\rquote s not just about avoiding blatant anachronisms (\ldblquote yes some cops used radios to keep in contact, but there were no portable hand-held radios that could be used away from patrol cars\rdblquote ). It\rquote s also about representing society in a believable fashion. How did people really live their lives in the era? How did the gadgets of the age support their life, and how did the limitations of technology impact of the lives of the average person?\par
The best way to make your Jazz Age games feel authentic is to do a little bit of research about the historical era before you dive headlong into creating your Mythos masterpiece. Calling it \ldblquote research\rdblquote  makes it seem like it\rquote s necessarily boring \endash  hitting the library (real or online) and diving into social histories of the inter-war period. If that\rquote s your bag, there are a lot of great resources that will reward your investment of time. But it\rquote s just as possible that your research might seek to learn details of the Jazz Age through movies or TV series set in the era. A few great examples of the latter category include:\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f2\'b7\tab\i\f1 Boardwalk Empire\i0  (TV Series, 2010\emdash 2014).\par
\f2\'b7\tab\i\f1 Carniv\'e0le\i0  (TV Series, 2003\emdash 2005).\par
\f2\'b7\tab\i\f1 Peaky Blinders\i0  (TV Series, 2013\emdash 2022).\par
\f2\'b7\tab\i\f1 Miller\rquote s Crossing\i0  (Coen Brothers Movie, 1990).\par
\f2\'b7\tab\i\f1 Something Wicked This Way Comes\i0  (1984 Dark Fantasy Movie).\par
\f2\'b7\tab\i\f1 Horror Express\i0  (1972 Movie with Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing and Telly Savalas; not technically set in the Jazz Age but close enough).\par
\f2\'b7\tab\i\f1 The Great Gatsby\i0  (the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel, or one of its several movie versions including the visually lavish 2013 Baz Luhrmann production).\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1 Naturally, when you\rquote re taking inspiration from non-horror fiction or media to build a compelling backdrop for your original horrific tale, the key to success is finding the right balance between period color and weird horror. Having lots of period detail is great, but an entire game which features nothing but gangsters and bootleggers will quickly bore a group that has turned up to your table expecting a weird fiction tale. Conversely, a game which is strong on \ldblquote established Mythos-continuity\rdblquote  but which feels like it\rquote s just a modern-day story with the serial number filed off and replaced with 1920s clich\'e9s, will come off as arbitrary. After all, if it makes no difference whether the tale is set in the Jazz Age or modern-day why should players go to the effort of getting into the right \ldblquote mood\rdblquote  for this unique setting? \par
As with everything the key is balance and adapting to what players will find most fun. As long as you listen to what your players say they want out of a game experience \endash  you will never fail when it comes to bringing a compelling investigative horror game alive at the table.\par

\pard\keep\keepn\s1\sl276\slmult1\f0 PART I: RULES OF THE GAME\par
\pard\sa120\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 This section describes the rules that all players will need to know to play a game of \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0 . It describes:\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f2\'b7\tab\f1 How to \b create characters\b0  whose roles players will adopt in the shared Lovecraftian stories;\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 How characters make use of their \b skills and attributes\b0  to try to overcome challenges they encounter;\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 How \b combat\b0  works, when things turn violent;\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 How the fragile \b sanity\b0  of each player\rquote s character may become eroded by encounters with horrors, both mundane and unnatural;\par
\pard\fi-357\li714\sa120\sl276\slmult1\f2\'b7\tab\f1 What player characters can do during the quiet \b downtime\b0  between perilous adventures against unnatural entities.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s1\fi-431\li431\sl276\slmult1\cf1\b\f0\fs28 1.0\tab Core Game Concepts\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 These rules tell you everything you need to know in order to play \i Cthulhu Eternal\f3 .\par
\i0\f1 As with most tabletop roleplaying games, when playing \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0  one player takes on the responsibility of setting the scene and narrating the events which make up a \i Cthulhu Eternal \i0 adventure. That individual is termed the \b Game Moderator\b0 . All other players take on the roles of individual every-day people from an era of human history who are swept up in investigating the Cthulhu Mythos. These characters are called \b Protagonists\b0  (with the term capitalized for clarity). Protagonists will encounter a multitude of other characters whose roles are \i not\i0  being played by other players \endash  those characters are called \b Non-Player Characters\b0  (or NPCs) and their actions are controlled by the Game Moderator.\par
In this book you\rquote ll find rules for creating Protagonists and a full set of rules for running adventures in a Lovecraftian world of your group\rquote s choosing or devising.\par
In addition to this book, you also need pencils to record changes to your character sheet, scratch paper to draw sketches and take notes, and dice.\par
\i Cthulhu Eternal\f3  \i0\f1 uses polyhedral dice common to tabletop role-playing games: four-sided, six-sided, eight-sided, ten-sided, twelve-sided, and twenty-sided. The game plays best when you have a few of each on the table. Or you can find automated dice rollers on the Web and as mobile apps.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s2\fi-576\li576\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0\fs26 1.1\tab Rolling the Dice\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 When the rules need you to roll dice, they use a particular nomenclature to save time and space: \ldblquote #D#,\rdblquote  as in \ldblquote 1D8\rdblquote  or \ldblquote 4D6.\rdblquote  The first number is the number of dice. The \ldblquote D\rdblquote  stands for \ldblquote dice with the following number of sides.\rdblquote  The second number is the number of faces on the die. \ldblquote 1D8\rdblquote  means roll one eight-sided die. \ldblquote 4D6\rdblquote  means roll four six-sided dice and add the numbers together. Sometimes you add or subtract a number from the roll. If it says \ldblquote 1D6+2,\rdblquote  that means roll one six-sided die and add two to the result.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s2\fi-576\li576\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0\fs26 1.2\tab Percentile Dice (\ldblquote 1D100\rdblquote )\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 Actions in \i Cthulhu Eternal\f3  \i0\f1 are resolved using \b percentile dice.\b0  That means you roll two ten-sided dice to get a number from 1 to 100. To do this, you don\rquote t add the individual die values together but instead treat each number as a digit (0\emdash 9). Before you make the roll, designate one die as the tens digit and the other as the ones digit. A zero (0) on the tens die counts as zero except when the ones die is also 0; then the 0 on the tens die counts as 10. For example:\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f2\'b7\tab\f1 The tens die comes up \ldblquote 0\rdblquote  and the ones die comes up \ldblquote 3\rdblquote : 03, or 3.\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 The tens die comes up \ldblquote 3\rdblquote  and the ones die comes up \ldblquote 0\rdblquote : 30.\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 Both dice come up \ldblquote 0\rdblquote : 100.\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 The tens die comes up \ldblquote 6\rdblquote  and the ones die comes up \ldblquote 2\rdblquote : 62.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s1\fi-432\li432\sb120\sl276\slmult1\cf1\b\f0\fs28 2.0\tab Protagonists\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 Your Protagonist represents the fictional persona that you will control in the game. You will spend a lot of time navigating your Protagonist through exciting and dangerous situations, so it is worth investing time in creating a character you will enjoy playing.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s2\fi-576\li576\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0\fs26 2.1\tab What Makes a Protagonist\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 All Protagonists are composed of six elements:\par
\b STATISTICS (STATS):\b0  Core capabilities for every Protagonist.\par
\b DERIVED ATTRIBUTES:\b0  Ratings that indicate physical and mental resilience, derived from stats.\par
\b ARCHETYPE:\b0  The type of role your Protagonist performs, which informs how many skill points and Bonds he or she has.\par
\b SKILLS:\b0  What training and education your Protagonist has picked up from being taught, or from life in general.\par
\b RESOURCES:\b0  An abstract rating that reflects your Protagonist\rquote s access to useful equipment or items.\par
\b BONDS:\b0  The people and communities your Protagonist fights to protect.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s2\fi-576\li576\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0\fs26 2.2\tab Protagonist Creation\par
\pard\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 Follow these steps to create a new Protagonist, or see \b HOW TO CREATE A PROTAGONIST\b0  on page \lang3081 7\lang1033  for a quick reference.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 2.2.1\tab STEP 0: Establish Harshness of Protagonist\rquote s Upbringing\par
\pard\cf0\b0\f1 Most Protagonist\rquote s upbringings will have been unremarkable \endash  but it\rquote s possible that yours grew up under especially challenging and punishing circumstances. For example, growing up amid a turbulent period of warfare or plague that killed most of those near-and-dear to the Protagonist. If you think that upbringing might have been harsh enough to scar your Protagonist, discuss it with your Game Moderator. Between you, decide whether the upbringing you envisage is best characterized by the descriptor \b Normal(-ish)\b0 , \b Harsh\b0 , or \b Very Harsh\b0 . See page \lang3081 9\lang1033  for a few examples of real-world disasters which could have brought tragedy to your Protagonist\rquote s childhood.\par
Usually, an upbringing warranting the descriptor \b Harsh\b0  will involve the Protagonist having spent at least 3-4 years of adolescence in a highly dangerous or adverse situation that only affected the specific region. This calamity is likely to have caused the untimely death of at least a couple of the character\rquote s immediate family.\par
For an upbringing to be considered \b Very Harsh\b0 , the whole of the Protagonists childhood and adolescence was likely marred by a dangerous, deadly, or otherwise toxic environment that was particular to their region. This terrible situation is likely to have resulted in the majority of the characters\rquote  family suffering greatly, with at least half having perished.\par
Any upbringing that isn\rquote t \b Harsh\b0  or \b Very Harsh\b0  is considered \b Normal(-ish).\b0\par
A harsher upbringing might make him or her a little stronger or hardier (since only the strong and hardy would have survived), but at the cost of mental scarring from the many horrific sights marring their childhood. \par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 2.2.2\tab STEP 1: Determine Statistics\par
\pard\cf0\b0\f1 Statistics are Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), Intelligence (INT), Power (POW), and Charisma (CHA). They range from 3 (the worst) to 18 (the best), with an average of 10 for an ordinary adult. Statistics represent core capabilities possessed by all Protagonists. All are important. (See \b DETAILED DESCRIPTION: STATISTICS\b0  on page \lang3081 8\lang1033 .)\par
\pard\sa120\sl276\slmult1 You can create stats in two ways: rolling them or assigning points. Pick a method.\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sa200\sl276\slmult1\b 1.\tab ROLL STATS: \b0 For each stat roll 4D6, drop the lowest of the four dice, and add up the other three. Place the six rolls in whichever stats you like.\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\b 2.\tab ASSIGN STATS: \b0 Divide 72 points among the six stats however you like, or pick one of the sets from page \lang3081 9\lang1033  and assign each score to one statistic.\par
\pard\sa120\sl276\slmult1 After the basic values are assigned for each statistic, modify according to the Harshness Descriptor for the setting:\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f2\'b7\tab\f1 For Protagonists in \b Harsh\b0  settings: add 1 to \i either\i0  STR \i or\i0  CON (player\rquote s choice)\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 For Protagonists in \b Very Harsh\b0  settings: add 1 to \i both\i0  STR \i and\i0  CON\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 2.2.3\tab STEP 2: Calculate Derived Attributes\par
\pard\cf0\b0\f1 Hit Points, Willpower Points, Sanity Points, and Breaking Point are derived from stats. They represent physical and mental resilience. When your Protagonist is hurt, exercises mental fortitude, or is traumatized, those scores can drop. If your Protagonist has a STR score that is outside the average range (9\emdash 12) he or she also has a modifier to the damage inflicted from hand-to-hand combat. (See \b DETAILED DESCRIPTION: DERIVED ATTRIBUTES & DAMAGE BONUS\b0  on page \lang3081 10\lang1033 .)\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 2.2.4\tab STEP 3: Select Archetype\par
\pard\cf0\b0\f1 What does your Protagonist do for a living (or just to stay alive)? Archetype dictates what skills your Protagonist has, his or her basic resource level, and the number of Bonds he or she possesses. (See \b DETAILED DESCRIPTION: ARCHETYPES\b0  on page \lang3081 11\lang1033 .) \par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 2.2.5\tab STEP 4: Calculate Resources Rating\par
\pard\cf0\b0\f1 The Resources rating is a number between 0 and 20 that reflects the Protagonist\rquote s access to valuable or useful equipment. A Protagonist\rquote s base Resources rating is dictated by his or her Archetype, however during later steps, you can sacrifice other potential bonus skills in favor of a higher resources score; conversely, you can agree to drop Resources rating of 0 (entirely without access to resources) and receive additional skills. (See \b DETAILED DESCRIPTION: RESOURCES\b0  on page \lang3081 18\lang1033 .)\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 2.2.6\tab STEP 5: Define Bonds\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 Bonds indicate the strength of relationships with the most important people and communities in your Protagonist\rquote s life \emdash  like a spouse, child, a long-time travelling companion, or a local community of people. Bonds help Protagonists resist mental trauma\emdash but as your Protagonist\rquote s life falls apart under the stress of the Mythos-haunted world, Bonds deteriorate. \par
There are \b two types of Bonds\b0  \endash  bonds with individuals and bonds with an entire community. The latter reflect the Protagonist\rquote s standing as part of the community and his or her ability to influence the group. \par
Each Individual Bond has a value that starts equal to your Protagonist\rquote s Charisma (CHA). \par
\pard Each Community Bond has a default value equal to half the Protagonist\rquote s Resources rating, however during creation of the Protagonist the player may elect to sacrifice potential skills in favor of a higher value. Conversely, the player may elect to take a Community Bond with a value of 1 (lowest possible social standing) and receive additional skills. (See \b DETAILED DESCRIPTION: BONDS\b0  on page \lang3081 23\lang1033 .)\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 2.2.7\tab STEP 6: Select Bonus & Adversity Skills\par
\pard\cf0\b0\f1 Skills require special training, and come from schooling, experience, or personal interest. Skills are measured from 0% (no training) to 99% (foremost expert in the world). (See \b DETAILED DESCRIPTION: SKILLS\b0  on page \lang3081 27\lang1033 .)\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 2.2.8\tab STEP 7: Determine Mental Damage from Harsh Environments\par
\pard\cf0\b0\f1 Protagonists that have grown up in difficult and brutal conditions are likely to have picked up some mental scarring along the way. This can leave them hardened to certain types of traumatic stimuli, distant from those around them, or afflicted with mental disorders. (see \b DETAILED DESCRIPTION: MENTAL DAMAGE FROM HARSH UPBRINGING\b0 , page \lang3081 36\lang1033 .)\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 2.2.9\tab STEP 8: Add the Final Details\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 Start filling in the details that make your Protagonist interesting.\par

\pard\sa120\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 The derived attributes \emdash  Hit Points, Willpower Points, Sanity Points, and Breaking Point \emdash  represent your Protagonist\rquote s physical and mental toughness. \par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1 Damage Bonus reflects whether his or her brawn (or lack thereof) will affect damage inflicted through brawling and hand-to-hand weapons.\par
\b HIT POINTS (HP):\b0  Hit Points represent how much damage your Protagonist can sustain. When the Protagonist is injured, subtract the damage from HP. At 2 HP, your Protagonist falls unconscious. At 0 HP, your Protagonist dies. Hit Points are regained through rest and medical attention.\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\qc\b\i Hit Points equal CON plus STR, divided by two and rounded up.\par
\pard\i0 WILLPOWER POINTS (WP):\b0  Willpower Points represent mental fortitude. They fall when your Protagonist attempts to suppress the symptoms of mental illness (see \b RESISTING INSANITY\b0  on page \lang3081 74\lang1033 ), becomes exhausted (see \b EXHAUSTION\b0  on page \lang3081 43\lang1033 ), attempts to resist persuasion, suffers emotional burnout (see \b FUMBLE\b0  on page \lang3081 40\lang1033 ), or tries to fuel unnatural phenomena. At 2 WP, your Protagonist has a temporary emotional collapse. At 0 WP, your Protagonist falls unconscious. Willpower Points are regained with rest. (See \b WILLPOWER POINTS\b0  on page \lang3081 42\lang1033 .)\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\qc\b\i Willpower Points equal POW.\par
\pard\i0 SANITY POINTS (SAN):\b0  Sanity Points represent mental health: how much mental trauma, or exposure to the unnatural your Protagonist can endure before going insane. In moments of mental trauma your Protagonist must make a \b Sanity test\b0  by rolling SAN or lower on 1D100. If that fails, your Protagonist loses SAN. (See \b SANITY\b0  on page \lang3081 65\lang1033 .) Sanity Points are regained through remedial care or by overcoming unnatural threats. At 0 Sanity Points, your Protagonist goes irretrievably insane and becomes an NPC permanently under the control of the Game Moderator.\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1 A Protagonist\rquote s starting Sanity Points depends on the Harshness of his or her upbringing \endash  the harsher the situation, the more brutality and horror the Protagonist has been scarred by.   \par
\pard\sl276\slmult1\qc\b\i Normal(ish) Setting: Sanity Points begin equal to POW\'d75.\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\qc Harsh or Very Harsh Setting: Sanity Points begin equal to POW\'d74.\par
\pard\i0 BREAKING POINT:\b0  The Breaking Point is the point at which loss of SAN triggers a long-term mental disorder. (See \b INSANITY AND DISORDERS\b0  on page \lang3081 68\lang1033 .)\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\qc\b\i A Protagonist\rquote s Breaking Point equals SAN minus POW.\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\b0\i0 The instant the Protagonist\rquote s SAN reaches the Breaking Point, he or she gains a disorder. Reset the Breaking Point to equal the new SAN score minus POW.\par
\pard\sl276\slmult1\b MAXIMUM SAN: \b0 The is the absolute maximum number of Sanity Points your Protagonist can EVER reach, by any means. Learning more about the true nature of the Cthulhu Mythos (represented by the Unnatural skill) reduces this number.\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\qc\b\i A Protagonist\rquote s Maximum SAN always equals 99 minus skill rating in the Unnatural Skill.\par
\pard\i0 RECOVERY SAN:\b0  This is the highest Sanity Point total that your Protagonist can possibly achieve through mundane methods \endash  relaxation, personal pursuits, caring for loved ones, and seeking help for mental illness. See \b RECOVERING SANITY\b0  on page \lang3081 75\lang1033 .\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 Each Protagonist is a representative of a broad category of character types, usually related to the job he or she performs in the game world. Each such category is called an \b Archetype\b0 . \par
An Archetype says a lot about a Protagonist. It grants a \ldblquote kit\rdblquote  of appropriate skills. It also determines the number of Bonds your Protagonist has when the game begins, and his or her starting Resource level.\par
\b RECOMMENDED STATS:\b0  Some Archetypes require people who are particularly fit, stable, or smart. This means the recommended stats should be 10 or higher \emdash  or at least they were when your Protagonist first started out being the Archetype. \par
\pard\b ARCHETYPAL SKILLS:\b0  Each Archetype has a predefined kit of skills with scores that replace the default skill ratings. This represents the baseline training, experience, and education for that Archetype. See \b DETAILED DESCRIPTION: SKILLS\b0  on page \lang3081 27\lang1033  for their uses.\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\b RESOURCES:\b0  Each Archetype dictates a base value for the Resources rating. \par
\b BONDS\b0 : Each Archetype dictates the number of Bonds your Protagonist begins with. Difficult and trying Archetypes mean fewer Bonds but more skills. The player can decide whether each of these Bonds refers to:\par
\pard\fi-360\li765\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f2\'b7\tab\f1 a relationship to an individual (Individual Bonds) or \par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 standing within a community (Community Bonds).\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 2.5.1\tab Customizing Your Protagonist With Other Skills\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 Don\rquote t worry if your Protagonist at this point looks like a generic representative of his or her chosen Archetype. While the Archetype defines a core set of abilities, those skills and ratings don\rquote t represent the full range of everything your Protagonist can do. \par
Later in the character generation process you will have opportunities to pick other skills they are also good at. There are two different types of skill picks:\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\caps\f2\'b7\tab\b\f1 Adversity Skill Point Picks\b0\caps0  (see page \lang3081 18\lang1033 ) represent abilities your Protagonist has because of the harsh environment that he or she grew up in. These picks can only be used to enhance a few specific skills, and cannot be traded in for other benefits.\par
\caps\f2\'b7\tab\b\f1 Bonus Skill Point Picks\b0\caps0  (see page \lang3081 26\lang1033 ) represent hobbies and general experience he or she learned above and beyond the basics associated with the Archetype. You start with \ul ten\ulnone  such bonus picks to use later in the Protagonist generation process. These picks \i can\i0  be traded in for other advantages like increased availability of resources-at-hand or standing in a community.\par

\pard\cf0\b0\f1 The following Archetypes are appropriate for Jazz Age games of Lovecraftian investigation. They don\rquote t cover every possible character type but focus on likely protagonists in mystery and investigation tales. The GM is encouraged to develop other archetypes to cover other character types suggested by players. Guidelines for developing new Archetypes may be found on page \lang3081 91\lang1033 .\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 Depending on the harshness of the environment where your Protagonist grew up, he or she may gain \b Adversity Skill Point Picks\b0 . Each such pick provides a 20-point increase in rating for one skill from a pre-defined list. \par
\pard\sl276\slmult1 The number of Adversity Skill Point Picks your Protagonist receives depends on the Harshness Descriptor relevant to their particular upbringing:\par

\pard\keep\keepn\s2\fi-576\li576\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0\fs26 2.7\tab Detailed Description: Resources\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 Every Protagonist has a Resources rating between 0 and 20. This number is an abstraction that represents the size, value, and utility of the \b personal pool of resources\b0  to which he or she has ready access. A Protagonist who is \ldblquote wealthy\rdblquote  in a material sense will have a high Resources rating, since they have personal ownership \endash  and hence access \endash  to more things. Conversely, someone who is destitute and forced to carry their meagre belongings on their back will probably have a very low Resources rating. The definition of what constitutes \ldblquote wealth\rdblquote  and \ldblquote valuable resources\rdblquote  might vary depending on the game setting, but the Resources rating is a handy abstract rating which compares the magnitude of the Protagonist\rquote s material possessions against other people\rquote s. \par
The Resources rating represents a pool of previously unspecified items \i in addition to\i0  any named pieces of equipment that appears on the Protagonist\rquote s character sheet.\par
There are two ways in which Resources ratings can become important during a game of \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0 :\par
\pard\fi-357\li714\sa200\sl276\slmult1 1.\tab The rating can be used as a measure of status and wealth which dictates how Non-Player Characters react to the Protagonists; a Protagonist who has a sizeable cache of resources might find NPCs more willing to listen to what he or she has to say \'85 or alternatively more likely to want to take some of those resources away.\par
2.\tab Game encounters may involve challenges which can be overcome through possession of particular \endash  possibly obscure \endash  items or resources; a Protagonist who fossicks through his or her trove of (unnamed) personal items may locate just the thing that is needed. Usually this requires a successful \b Resources test\b0  (a 1D100 roll against \b Resources\b0  \b\'d7\b0  \b 5\b0 ). \par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1 A Protagonist\rquote s Resources rating may change during play as especially significant items are pulled from the \ldblquote bag of tricks\rdblquote , items are destroyed, or new equipment caches are picked over for useful additions.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 2.7.1\tab Determining the Starting Resources rating\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 Your Protagonist\rquote s Archetype determines the starting value for his or her Resources rating; it is a number listed as part of the Archetype description.\par
\pard If you would prefer this value to be higher, you have the option to \ldblquote trade-in\rdblquote  one or more \b BONUS SKILL POINT\b0  picks (see page \lang3081 26\lang1033 ). For the first such skill pick traded-in, your Protagonist receives a +5 boost to Resources rating. Each additional pick you trade in beyond the first, grants your Protagonist a further +2 boost to Resources. You may sacrifice as many skill picks as you wish, although each will reduce your opportunities to round-out your Protagonist with extra skills during a later step of Protagonist creation.\par
Alternatively, if you would prefer to play a Protagonist who is entirely bereft of resources (i.e., has a Resources rating of 0), you can choose to do so and in return receive one extra Bonus Skill Point Pick for later use.\par
\pard\sl276\slmult1\b Rating\tab\tab What the Rating Represents\par
\pard\b0 0 \tab\tab No ownership of any item of value or function. Penury. Near starvation.\par
1-4\tab\tab Owns only basic and valueless items; barely enough to eke out a basic life. Always hungry.\par
5-8\tab\tab Owns a sparse collection of valuable or useful items, some in terrible condition. Sometimes hungry.\par
9-12\tab\tab Owns a modest cache of valuable, useful items. Usually has basic food.\par
\pard\fi-1440\li1440 13-16\tab Owns a fair stock of low-grade valuable items. Occasional access to superior food.\par

\pard If you need to know how your Resources Rating translates to financial wealth, consult the table in the \b BUYING EQUIPMENT\b0  section (page \lang3081 60\lang1033 ).\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 2.7.2\tab Permanent Resources, Resources At-Hand, and Resource Checks\par
\pard\sa120\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 The full value established above is called the Protagonist\rquote s \b Permanent Resources\b0  rating, since it measures the sum total of everything he or she owns \endash  regardless of where it is kept. \par
Carrying around a lot of bulky equipment everywhere is usually not practical, so Protagonists with significant Resources ratings (7+ points) will usually need to \b stow\b0  some of their junk in a vehicle or on a pack animal. Those with even more resources will need to \b store \b0 the overflow in a fixed \lquote home base\rquote  location. \par
The table nearby shows a breakdown of \lquote at hand\rquote  vs \lquote stowed\rquote  vs \lquote in storage\rquote  Resource rating points. There is space on the Protagonist sheet to record this breakdown of the total Permanent Resource rating into the three categories. The three numbers (\lquote at-hand\rquote , \lquote stowed\rquote , and \lquote in storage\rquote ) must always add up to the Permanent Resources rating. \par
The Permanent Resources rating measures both the quantity of items your Protagonist has dedicated access to, and their usefulness. This in turn governs \i how many times\i0  per adventure the Protagonist can successfully pull out useful items before the pool is temporarily exhausted. \par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1 In game terms this is represented by the number of \b Resource Check boxes\b0  the Protagonist has available \endash  these are explained further below. The number of check boxes available to your Protagonist is also indicated on the table nearby: record it on the Protagonist Sheet by blacking out but those boxes available to the Protagonist (e.g., for a Protagonist with only one checkbox available, fill in all but one of the available boxes with solid black \endash  use pencil since your Protagonist may open up more boxes later).\par

\pard\keep\keepn\s4\sb40\sl276\slmult1\cf1\i\f0 Pushing the Limits\par
\pard\sa120\sl276\slmult1\cf0\i0\f1 As indicated in the table, it is typically only possible for your Protagonist to keep 6 points of Resources on their person (\lquote at-hand\rquote ) and another 6 points \lquote stowed\rquote  in a handy vehicle or on a handy animal. These aren\rquote t hard and fast limits, but represent what can comfortably be carried/transported without impacting travel speed and convenience. If situations arise where the Protagonist really needs to carry more (e.g., carry the entire 10 points of Permanent Resources by hand while fleeing a burning building), it is up to the Game Moderator to decide what is possible and what impacts might arise from your Protagonist or vehicle being \lquote overloaded\rquote . The Game Moderator might rule this has an impact on the rate of travel, or require some kind of skill test to keep moving forward under excess load. \par
Generally, stretching the limits beyond 12 points carried \lquote at hand\rquote  or 12 points \lquote stowed\rquote  is impossible.\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1 There is no limit to the amount of Resources rating points that can be \lquote in storage\rquote  at a fixed location (e.g., a home base or workshop).\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s4\sb40\sl276\slmult1\cf1\i\f0 Which Rating for a Test?\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\i0\f1 Any time your Protagonist\rquote s Resources rating is the subject of a test, the effective rating number that is used should reflect the situation. It should be determined by the amount of Resources available to your Protagonist at that moment. If he or she is at home base, that will probably be the full Permanent Resources amount; if your Protagonist is close to his or her vehicle (or pack animal) that might be the \lquote at-hand\rquote  value PLUS the stowed value. If your Protagonist is far away from both home base and vehicle/animal, the number is likely to be just the \lquote at-hand\rquote  number.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s4\sb40\sl276\slmult1\cf1\i\f0 Which Rating for NPC Reactions?\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\i0\f1 When using Resources as a means of determining Non-Player Character reactions, the rating that is used also depends on the situation. Does the NPC in question know all about your Protagonist\rquote s reputation as a \lquote wealthy\rquote  sort? If so, maybe the full Permanent Resources score can be used even if only some of that wealth is currently on display. Alternatively, if the NPC is suspicious of your Protagonist, it might be hard to get him or her to believe in the existence of any resources beyond what they can see for themselves.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 2.7.3\tab The Bag of Tricks\par
\pard\sa120\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 The higher your Protagonist\rquote s effective Resources rating, the higher the likelihood that his or her accessible personal cache of items may contain something helpful to a situation or problem.\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f2\'b7\tab\f1 In situations where \b non-specialist resources or items\b0  are needed, simply make a test of your Protagonist\rquote s Resources \'d7 5. Success means that something helpful was found. \par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 In cases where a situation requires a \b very specialized\b0  resource or item, the Game Moderator might rule it is too rare to find in your Protagonist\rquote s pool of gear. Alternatively, the GM \i may\i0  still permit a test of Resources \'d7 5 roll to locate the rare equipment \endash  \ul\i but\ulnone\i0  rule that success will \b permanently reduce\b0  your Protagonist\rquote s Resources rating by a few points (the number being at the Game Moderator\rquote s discretion).\par
\pard Depending on the specific game setting, the difficulty of Resources tests and the quality of the items unearthed through successful rolls may vary. See \b SCROUNGING EQUIPMENT\b0  starting page \lang3081 60\lang1033 .\par
\pard\sl276\slmult1 Rules of Thumb:\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f2\'b7\tab\f1 Tests to find items or resource types that are considered \i Hard to Get\i0  in the setting are made at HALF the Protagonist\rquote s effective Resources rating\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 Tests to find items or resource types that are considered \i Very Hard to Get\i0  or \i Impossible to Get\i0  in the setting are made at QUARTER the Protagonist\rquote s effective Resources rating\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 A test that is a standard success, but which is only just under the target number might yield a sub-standard version of the item or resource. A critical success will always yield the best possible quality available.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 2.7.4\tab Checkboxes and Per-Adventure Limits\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 While your Protagonist\rquote s personal Resources can prove helpful during an adventure, there are practical limits to the number of times that items can be pulled from it during a single adventure. \par
\pard After each Resources test resulting in success, place a check mark in one of the Resource Check boxes on the Protagonist\rquote s character sheet. When all the boxes are full, the Protagonist\rquote s resources pool is temporarily exhausted and can\rquote t contribute anything more until he or she has some downtime to replenish or reorganize it (see\lang3081  \lang1033\b\caps Replenishing Resources, Removing Checkmarks\b0\caps0 , page \lang3081 23\lang1033 ).\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 2.7.5\tab Pooling Resources\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 Sometimes, it may be appropriate for two or more Protagonists to pool their personal caches of items to improve the likelihood of finding a rare but crucial component. Any Protagonist can contribute items to the pool, as long as he or she hasn\rquote t temporarily exhausted their resource pool (by filling all check boxes).\par
When making a roll to search such a \b combined\b0  resource pool, the effective Resources rating of the collection is equal to the \b highest\b0  individual Resources rating included in the collection \b plus ONE FIFTH\b0  of the Resources rating of every additional individual stockpile added to the heap (round fractions up). This reflects duplication of items or functions.\par
Success on a combined test causes a check mark to be placed on the sheet of the Protagonist whose FULL Resources rating was used. Others who contributed a smaller amount to the total do not receive a check mark.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 2.7.6\tab Losing Resources\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 A Protagonist\rquote s Resources rating may decrease due to events that occur during play:\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f2\'b7\tab\f1 As described above, producing a highly specialized item as the result of a Resources test may cause the Permanent Resources rating to be reduced by one or more.\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 If the Protagonist is robbed or otherwise loses control of a significant amount of his or her personal equipment, the Game Moderator may decide this warrants a loss of a proportional amount of Resources rating.\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 If a proportion of the Protagonist\rquote s resources are stowed in a vehicle or on a pack animal, the theft or destruction of the conveyance is likely to cause some or all to be lost, the exact proportion decided by the Game Moderator.\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 If a proportion of the Protagonist\rquote s resources are stored in a fixed location, a disaster that outright destroys or significantly damages the location will likewise cause a reduction to permanent Resources. The points lost are based on the number of \lquote in storage\rquote  rating points stored at the location (i.e., not carried or stowed). The same loss may occur if the permanent location becomes invaded or overtaken by a hostile party \endash  although in that situation the loss might be temporary, assuming the Protagonists can win back their former stronghold at some future date.\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1 Whenever Resource rating decreases, the player should recalculate the \ldblquote at-hand\rdblquote /stowed/stored breakdown of points as well as the number of check boxes available to the Protagonist. \par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 2.7.7\tab Increasing the Resources Rating During Play\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 During a \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0  adventure your Protagonist may gain access to a cache of items ripe for the taking. When this occurs, the Game Moderator will decide the number of Resources rating points each Protagonist might potentially plunder. For a small find this might be modest (1 point or 1D2 points), but for a massive discovery it could be a healthy improvement (1D6 or higher).\par
Increasing your Protagonist\rquote s Permanent Resources rating requires a die roll. With percentile dice, attempt to roll above \b Permanent Resources rating \'d7 5.\b0  This reflects the fact that the more your Protagonist already owns, the harder it is to acquire additional new items he or she does not already have. If the test is successful, increase the Resources rating by the amount or die roll indicated by the GM.\par
Whenever Resource rating increases, the player should recalculate the \ldblquote at-hand\rdblquote /stowed/stored breakdown of points as well as the number of check boxes available to the Protagonist.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 2.7.8\tab Replenishing Resources, Removing Checkmarks\par
\pard\cf0\b0\f1 The Game Moderator will determine when your Protagonist group can take the time to replenish or reorganize their Resources pools. Usually this happens between missions, expeditions, or adventures (see \b DOWNTIME\b0 , page \lang3081 76\lang1033 ). Once the Protagonists have invested an appropriate period of downtime all check marks can be erased from the character sheet.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s2\fi-576\li576\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0\fs26 2.8\tab Detailed Description: Bonds\par
\pard\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 Bonds measure your Protagonist\rquote s relationships with the vital people and societies in his or her life: loved ones, family members, and wider communities. A Bond can protect your Protagonist from SAN loss (see \b PROJECTING ONTO A BOND\b0  on page \lang3081 75\lang1033 ) or offer a chance to repress the effects of a disorder or temporary insanity (see \b REPRESSING INSANITY\b0  on page \lang3081 75\lang1033 ).\par
Bonds are not merely motivations or things your Protagonist likes. They are your Protagonist\rquote s connection to humanity and its social structures. A Protagonist with no Bonds is more susceptible to psychological trauma than one who has people waiting back home.\par
Your Protagonist\rquote s Archetype determines how many Bonds your Protagonist begins with. The more trying and time-consuming the Archetype, the fewer Bonds your Protagonist is able to maintain.\par
There are two distinct types of Bonds, each handled slightly differently \endash  they are \b Individual Bonds\b0  and \b Community Bonds. \b0 When creating a Protagonist, you are free to choose which of his or her starting bonds is of each type.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 2.8.1\tab Individual Bonds\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 An Individual Bond is an emotional connection to a single person. It could be familial or marital, or it could just be a close friendship or association. To qualify as an Individual Bond the person must be someone the Protagonist believes (hopes?) to be still alive. \par
Each Individual Bond begins with a score equal to your Protagonist\rquote s CHA. It cannot typically go above this value.\par
\pard\b Sample Individual Bonds\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sa200\b0\f2\'b7\tab\f1 Spouse or ex-spouse\i\par

\pard\keep\keepn\s4\sb40\sl276\slmult1\cf1\f0 Changes to Individual Bonds During Play\par
\pard\cf0\i0\f1 Bonds\rquote  scores often deteriorate because of your Protagonist\rquote s experiences of the horrors of the Mythos-haunted world. A Bond increases if it is cultivated between adventures (see \b DOWNTIME\b0  on page \lang3081 76\lang1033 ). An Individual Bond can never have a score higher than your Protagonist\rquote s CHA. Any time CHA drops, each Individual Bond drops by the same amount.\par
Individual Bonds are vulnerable. If the Protagonist learns that the individual has died or gone permanently insane, the Bond is destroyed. The Bond is also permanently broken when its score drops to 0 (see \b BROKEN BONDS\b0 , nearby).\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 2.8.2\tab Community Bonds\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 A Community Bond is a relationship between the Protagonist and a broader community of individuals; it reflects the Protagonist\rquote s status within that community, and the likelihood of other people following his or her instructions or desires. \par
A community may be a geographical association of people or it may be a society of like-minded individuals (e.g., a club, congregation, or association). A Protagonist can have more than one Community Bond, each describing his or her status within the hierarchy of a different societal structure.\par
Community Bonds are measured on a scale of 1 to 20, with an indicative meaning shown below:\par
\pard\sl276\slmult1\b Rating\tab\tab What the Rating Represents\par
\pard\b0 1\tab\tab Disgraced member; on the verge of being banished from the society.\par
2-4\tab\tab Shunned member of the community; someone who is actively looked down on by most\par
5-8\tab\tab Standard member of the community; one of the pack, whose opinion is unlikely to matter\par
9-12\tab\tab Well-regarded member of the community; favorably viewed by many other members\par
\pard\fi-1440\li1440 13-16\tab Important member of the community; respected by most other members\par
17-18\tab Influential member of community, involved in most decision-making; liked by most\par
19\tab An extremely influential member of the community, looked up to by virtually everyone\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1 20\tab\tab Top-tier of leadership in the community; the head honcho.\par
\pard If a Community Bond is chosen during the creation of your Protagonist, it typically begins with a default rating of \ul half\ulnone  the Protagonist\rquote s Permanent Resources rating, rounded up (see \b RESOURCES\b0  on page \lang3081 18\lang1033 ). In a few cases, a Protagonist\rquote s Archetype indicates that he or she has a Community Bond with a certain fixed rating \endash  the final rating should be either that value or half the Permanent Resources rating, whichever is higher. \par
This value can be optionally increased during the creation of your Protagonist by sacrificing one or more \b BONUS SKILL POINT\b0  picks (see page \lang3081 26\lang1033 ); the first skill pick sacrificed in this manner gives a bonus of +5 to the Community Bond\rquote s rating; each subsequent sacrifice adds +2 (to a maximum of 20). \par
It is also possible to elect for your Protagonist to take a Community Bond with a rating of 1 (and suffer the social effects of being a pariah to fellow members) and receive one extra Bonus Skill Point Pick to use on purchasing skills later in the process.\par
\b Sample Community Bonds\par

\pard\keep\keepn\s4\sb40\sl276\slmult1\cf1\f0 Changes to Community Bonds During Play\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\i0\f1 The rating for a Community Bond applies individually to every member of that community, and to the community as a whole. If a Community Bond decreases in value, the relationship with each member of the community deteriorates. A Community Bond is permanently broken when its score drops to 0 (and the Protagonist is likely cast out of the nominated community). \par
If the community itself is entirely destroyed (e.g., every member killed or sent insane), or if the Protagonist permanently leaves it (e.g., by relocating to live in a new region) the bond is destroyed.\par
If a Community Bond is broken by either means, the Protagonist will likely suffer negative impacts (see \b BROKEN BONDS\b0 , nearby).\par
During play, events may arise where the reactions of NPCs from the Protagonist\rquote s bonded community (or the community as a whole) have an impact. In some cases, the Protagonist may instigate such situations (e.g., by requesting aid from the community or trying to convince them of impending danger). In such situations the Game Moderator may ask for a test against \b Community Bond Rating \'d7 5.\b0  Success means that the NPC or the community reacts favorably.\par

An Individual Bond must be a real person or group of people who the Protagonist believes to be alive, and with which there is some (potential) opportunity to interact. \par
A Community Bond must be a real group who recognizes the Protagonist as a member.\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 When a Bond deteriorates, that relationship becomes strained. Exactly what shape that takes in play is up to you and the Game Moderator (playing the NPCs). \par
Bonds often fall apart because of events beyond your Protagonist\rquote s control. An example for Individual Bonds: your Protagonist\rquote s husband might leave for another woman. An example for Community Bonds: a new leader might ascend to power who is actively antagonistic towards your Protagonist.\par
If such a disaster harms the subject of a Bond, that reduces the Bond\rquote s value by 1D4. If that disaster permanently removes the subject of the Bond, that Bond is gone. Cross it off the sheet.\par
\pard When damage to a Bond reduces it to 0, the relationship is damaged beyond repair. Cross it off the sheet. The only way to regain a Bond with that character or community is to build it from scratch as if it had never existed (see \b DOWNTIME\b0  on page \lang3081 76\lang1033  for details on creating new Bonds).\par
The breaking of any Bond is almost certainly traumatic and is likely to trigger a Sanity test due to Helplessness (see page \lang3081 67\lang1033 ).\par
When you cross a Bond off your Protagonist\rquote s character sheet, don\rquote t erase it. After all, there\rquote s no forgetting a vital relationship that went bad. \par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 Protagonists often band together into small tight-knit groups, to enhance their chances. This is true when the group is alone in the wasteland; it\rquote s often also true even when they are outsiders in a larger settlement. If those tight-knit groups go through terrifying ordeals together, there is a strong chance that they will become psychologically bound together through that shared experience. \par
In game terms, groups of Protagonists tend to form individual bonds to one another when they spend most of their time fighting the forces of the Mythos. Whenever your Protagonist is part of a team that completes a harrowing adventure, there\rquote s a chance of such trauma-generated bonds forming or deepening. This is the case if the scenario played out in a way where:\par

\pard In the downtime after the adventure (see \b DOWNTIME\b0  on page \lang3081 76\lang1033 ), all Protagonists that made it back must make a SAN test. If the roll succeeds, nothing changes. If your Protagonist fails the SAN roll, he or she gains or strengthens an individual bond with EACH fellow Protagonist who also made it through the same trauma (up to a maximum of five fellow Protagonists). \par

\pard\fi-360\li825\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f2\'b7\tab\f1 If your Protagonist has \b no previous bond\b0  with that person, he or she gains a brand-new individual Bond to that person at a rating equal to half your Protagonist\rquote s CHA. Add the new Bond to your Protagonist\rquote s character sheet. This focusing of attention comes at a detrimental cost to other pre-existing Bonds \endash  you must lose 1D4 points from one other bond of your choice (either an Individual or Community Bond).\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 If your Protagonist \b already has an Individual Bond\b0  with that person, the bond is increased by 1D4 points (up to a maximum value equal to CHA); at the same time 1 point must be subtracted from another bond of the player\rquote s choice (either an Individual or Community Bond). Note that even if all your Protagonist\rquote s existing bonds are already at the maximum score (and hence can\rquote t increase), you still need to pick a bond to weaken by 1.\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1 Remember that if a Bond is ever reduced to 0 or less it is broken, as per the previous section. \par
When choosing a Bond to weaken during this process you CANNOT pick a bond to an individual who was with your Protagonist on the recently completed adventure. You MAY, however, pick an Individual Bond gained from an earlier shared traumatic encounter.\par
Rather than treating this as a mechanical process, you and your Game Moderator are encouraged to work together to describe the changed dynamic between your Protagonist and those around them. If points have been gained with fellow adventurers, does that mean they are beginning to feel comfort that their colleagues will always have their back? Or has the shared experience kindled a romance of sorts? Conversely, if a bond has been weakened, does that mean the Protagonist has been neglecting a member of their circle of friends and both are now feeling their friendship is slipping away? \par
If a community bond has weakened does it mean that the excessive time spent socializing with the tight-knit group has alienated others in the community to the point that they have lost confidence in the Protagonist? Or has he or she just missed so many gatherings that their standing as a high-status member of society has eroded?\par

\pard\cf0\b0\f1 For details of specific skills, see the listing in \b SKILL DESCRIPTIONS\b0  starting on page \lang3081 29\lang1033 . \par
When your Protagonist uses a skill, sometimes you roll dice and sometimes you don\rquote t.\par
\b USING A SKILL WITHOUT A ROLL:\b0  When circumstances are calm and controlled, you don\rquote t roll dice to have your Protagonist use a skill; the Game Moderator just needs to know how high your Protagonist\rquote s rating is. \par
\lang3081 For example, safely driving a shiny new Packard roadster when things are calm might simply require a certain amount in the Drive skill.\lang1033  \par
Using a skill without rolling means randomness is not a factor. It\rquote s about having the right skill, looking in the right place, and asking the right questions. The more subtle the clue, the higher the skill your Protagonist must have to figure it out.\par
\b USING A SKILL WITH A ROLL:\b0  Roll skill dice only when the outcome is in doubt. That usually means there\rquote s a crisis or the circumstances are not under your Protagonist\rquote s control. The higher the skill rating, the better your Protagonist\rquote s chance of success. For details, see \b USING SKILLS\b0  on page \lang3081 37\lang1033 .\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 2.10.3\tab Common Knowledge\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 Most Protagonists picked up some basic knowledge as they grew up. Because of this, they have some basic understanding of common things like how their society works and what types of jobs do what; and some basic abilities like how to flee danger. These don\rquote t require specific skills. Skills represents deep, specialized training or education, but Protagonists can sometimes get by on common knowledge. Calling on common knowledge requires an \b INT\'d75\b0  test or having a certain level of INT. Charming someone with unskilled art is usually a \b CHA\b0  or \b DEX\b0  test. Other efforts use other stats. The Game Moderator decides whether a task requires the general ability of a stat or the specialization of a skill.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 2.10.4\tab Improving Skills\par
\pard\cf0\b0\f1 We learn from failure. If your Protagonist has at least 1% in a skill (any except Unnatural), it can improve when your Protagonists attempts to use it and \i fails\i0 . Gaining an entirely new skill requires special training (see \b DOWNTIME \b0 on page \lang3081 76\lang1033 ).\par
On the character sheet, next to every skill except Unnatural, there is a check box. When your Protagonist tries to use a skill and fails, put a checkmark in that skill\rquote s box. At the end of each game session, add 1D4 percentage point to every skill that has a check next to it and erase the check.\par
\b FAILING WITHOUT ROLLING:\b0  If your Protagonist attempts a challenging task that requires a certain level of skill but not a roll, and fails because the task requires more skill than your Protagonist has, put a check in the box.\par

The world seems mundane, but this is a fa\'e7ade. In dark corners and hidden places, the extra-dimensional and extra-terrestrial horrors lurk.

Others who learn the true nature of reality \endash  of those dark entities, and insane devotees they inspire \endash  cannot help but make a stand to defeat their terrible plans. These are Protagonists. Their fight might be never-ending, but the cost of losing is too great. They are the line that separates the sane world we know and the Apocalypse.  \par
\lang3081 Protagonists are usually every-day people who have been awakened to the truth about our world. They usually aren't superhuman, powerful, or invulnerable. Rather, they are frequently humble, vulnerable, and fragile individuals who have chosen to fight the unknowable but vast powers of the Cthulhu Mythos.

Sometimes using a skill requires a roll of dice. The most important rule is this: \i The Game Moderator determines if, when, and what you roll\i0 . If the Game Moderator says a roll isn\rquote t needed, the skill rating itself determines success or failure.\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 If the Game Moderator decides you don\rquote t need to roll, it comes down to what you\rquote re trying to do and how high your Protagonist\rquote s skill is. If the fact is common knowledge for your Protagonist\rquote s Archetype, or can be found with a little research, he or she might be able to get it by just expending time and effort. If it requires special knowledge, your Protagonist may need a certain amount of a skill.\par
If the Game Moderator thinks a fact should be known by a history expert with at least 60% skill, then a Protagonist with a relevant history-related skill at 60% or better knows the fact without rolling. Or perhaps a Protagonist with 40% can learn some clues but a Protagonist with 60% would learn more.\par
Sometimes a combination of skills can overcome a lack in one. A clue that needs 60% in a history-related skill might be available if the Protagonist has both a history skill \i and\i0  some other relevant skill at 40%.\par

Roll your skill test rating or lower to succeed. Rolling higher than the skill test rating means failure.\par
There are three criteria for rolling dice for a skill test:\par
\b ROLL WHEN IT IS DIFFICULT:\b0  A skill test means the Protagonist is attempting something \i difficult\i0 . After all, even an expert in a skill might have only a 60% or 70% rating. A skill test is for a situation when even an expert might fail.\par
\b ROLL WHEN THE SITUATION IS UNPREDICTABLE:\b0  Having to roll means the situation is out of control. Randomness plays a major role. Surprising, possibly disastrous things can happen, no matter how skillful you are.\par
\b ROLL WHEN THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES:\b0  Failing a skill roll means ugly things are going to happen. Maybe failing at the crisis is the punishment \emdash  or with a failed roll, your Protagonist succeeds but the consequences are severe. The fallout is up to the Game Moderator.\par

A stat test is the relevant stat \'d7 5. (So with STR 11, a STR test is 55%.)\par
Use STR if the challenge requires physical power, CON if it requires endurance, DEX if it requires agility, INT if it requires attention to detail, POW if it requires mental resilience, or CHA if it requires charm.\par
\pard The stat\rquote s score itself may tell the Game Moderator whether your Protagonist succeeds, without the need for a roll. Does it need someone with at least average Strength? Then your Protagonist needs a STR of 10 or more. If it needs someone with above-average Intelligence, your Protagonist must have an INT of at least 13. If only one person in a hundred would have enough stamina, your Protagonist needs a CON of 17 or 18. (See \b DETAILED DESCRIPTION: STATISTICS\b0  on page \lang3081 8\lang1033 .)\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 A critical success is a roll of 01 or any success where the dice digits match one another. So if your Protagonist\rquote s skill is 50%, you achieve a critical success with a roll of 01, 11, 22, 33, or 44. A critical success automatically succeeds, and exceeds expectations. A critical is \i twice as good \i0 as an ordinary success.

There may be times when a failed roll means a Protagonist achieves what he or she wanted \emdash  but it comes with an unpleasant complication. The Game Moderator always decides whether that\rquote s the case and what the cost will be. For a few possibilities, see the effects of fumbling a roll.\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 A fumble is a roll of 00 (100) or any failure where the dice digits match one another. So if your Protagonist\rquote s skill is 50%, you fumble on a roll of 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, or 00. A fumbled roll fails, no matter how high your Protagonist\rquote s chance of success, and has additional, catastrophic consequences.\par
\lang3081 In a car chase, a fumble might mean your Protagonist crashes. In a gunfight, a weapon might jam, or you might accidentally shoot yourself.\lang1033  \par

There is no way to change the roll or to re-roll to achieve a different outcome.\par
Some players, however, prefer to have an option for dice rolls to be nudged: for \ldblquote near misses\rdblquote  to be turned into successes at some other cost to the character. This optional rule delivers that, by allowing characters to sacrifice Willpower Points (WPs) to \ldblquote nudge\rdblquote  the dice rolled for a skill or stat test. Using this optional rule makes the game slightly less harsh in terms of the randomness of the dice, but also adds a resource-management element to players rationing their Willpower Points.\par
\pard\intbl\sl276\slmult1 Here\rquote s how nudging works for skill tests and stat tests:\par
\pard\intbl\fi-360\li720\f2\'b7\tab\f1 After a test has been rolled, a player can elect to spend any number of WPs, with each spend adjusting the dice roll either up or down as the player prefers.\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 Each WP spent adjusts the original dice roll by \b 1\emdash 5 percentiles (player\rquote s choice)\b0 .\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1\ldblquote Nudging\rdblquote  a dice roll that originally indicated a failure may convert it into a roll indicating standard success; alternatively, a dice roll that was originally a standard success may be turned into a failure.\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 This process cannot be used to alter the dice roll for a test performed by someone other than the character making the WP spend. Specifically, it cannot be used to modify the dice roll of an adversary.\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 The sacrifice of WPs represents the character investing extra energy and focus to ensure that a borderline situation is resolved in the desired way. Doing this can trigger exhaustion and may make the tired character more susceptible to being affected by arcane powers, and less prepared to participate in rituals.\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1\ldblquote Nudging\rdblquote  a dice roll can never create a critical success or a fumble, and dice rolls that originally indicated a critical success or fumble cannot be \ldblquote nudged\rdblquote . Even if the dice roll total obtained after a \ldblquote nudge\rdblquote  is applied happens to be a number with matching digits, the result is still either a standard success or a failure.\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 Remember that, as described in \b WILLPOWER POINTS\b0  (page \lang3081 42\lang1033 ), consequences may apply to a character whose WP total falls below 3. \par
\pard\intbl\sb200\fs22 Note: only skill tests and stat tests can be \ldblquote nudged\rdblquote  in this way; SAN test and Luck tests cannot be \ldblquote nudged\rdblquote . \cell\row\trowd\trgaph108\trleft5\trbrdrl\brdrs\brdrw10 \trbrdrt\brdrs\brdrw10 \trbrdrr\brdrs\brdrw10 \trbrdrb\brdrs\brdrw10 \trpaddl108\trpaddr108\trpaddfl3\trpaddfr3

Another question to agree upon is whether \ldblquote nudging\rdblquote  is available \ul solely\ulnone  to Protagonists in the game or also an action that NPCs can perform. \cell\row\pard\keep\keepn\s2\fi-576\li576\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\lang1033\b\i0\f0\fs26 3.3\tab The Luck Roll\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 Events often come down to pure chance. \par

If the Game Moderator calls for a Luck roll, there\rquote s a 50% chance that things go your Protagonist\rquote s way. It doesn\rquote t depend on psychic talent or your Protagonist\rquote s connection with the cosmos or anything else. Just roll the dice.

\pard\keep\keepn\s2\fi-576\li576\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0\fs26 3.4\tab Time Required\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 Sometimes speed counts. The Game Moderator determines how long it takes to perform a test.\par
\pard\b TURNS:\b0  It takes a few combat turns (see \b THE TURN \b0 on page \lang3081 44\lang1033 ) or, at most, sixty seconds. Combat, some skill tests, and most stat tests are resolved in turns.\par
\b MINUTES:\b0  It takes a few minutes. You can\rquote t do it in combat, but otherwise, your Protagonist can get through it rapidly. Many skill tests are resolved in minutes.\par
\b HOURS:\b0  It takes hours. Your Protagonist can typically attempt two to four such tasks per day (four only if your Protagonist goes without rest; see \b EXHAUSTION\b0  on page \lang3081 43\lang1033 ).\par
\b DAYS:\b0  It takes a day or more. Some extended skill tests, requiring multiple rolls, take days.\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\b LONG-TERM:\b0  Efforts that take place outside normal gameplay, like research and training, fit here. It could be a week, a month, or years. It\rquote s up to the Game Moderator.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s2\fi-576\li576\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0\fs26 3.5\tab Opposed Tests\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 An opposed test happens when someone takes action to interfere with another\rquote s action. \par
\lang3081 This might be a player rolling a Protagonist\rquote s Insight to sense the lies in a slimy politician's Persuade roll, a Protagonist escaping a pursuer with opposed Athletics tests, a degenerate cultist trying to wrestle a sacrificial victim to the ground in opposed Unarmed Combat tests, or a Protagonist\rquote s Dodge trying to oppose an alien monstrosity\rquote s attack roll.\lang1033\par
Usually, skills oppose skills and stats oppose stats. A stat opposes a skill only when one character must use very specific knowledge or training (and therefore rolls a skill) but the other does not (and therefore rolls a stat). It is up to the Game Moderator.\par
By nature, opposed tests are very unlikely to succeed. Not only must your roll succeed, but you must overcome the opposition\rquote s roll as well.\par
If two characters\rquote  skills oppose each other but neither needs to roll, the higher rating wins.\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 A pursuit is a series of opposed tests. The most basic chase is a single test for each side, pursuer and quarry. If the quarry wins, he or she escapes and the chase ends. If the pursuer wins, he or she (or it) runs the quarry down and the chase ends. Usually that means combat.\par
A more prolonged chase may require two wins by one side or the other. Wins cancel each other out. If the pursuer wins one but the quarry wins the next, that cancels out the pursuer\rquote s win. Then, the quarry needs to win twice more to escape. An especially wide-open chase might require three wins to either catch up or escape.\par
In each test, one side or the other wins. If both fail their rolls, the lowest failure wins. A critical success with a chase test counts as two wins. A fumble counts as two failures thanks to a wreck or some other disastrous accident.\par
\b WHICH SKILL APPLIES:\b0  \lang3081 A chase on foot requires Athletics; one in vehicles uses Drive, Pilot, or even Heavy Machinery; in the water, it uses Swim; on horseback, it uses Ride.\lang1033\par
\b AID AND ADVANTAGES:\b0  Coordinating with multiple pursuers (whether they\rquote re in sight of each other or have constant contact by some means), or being substantially faster and/or more maneuverable grants a +20% bonus to each chase test, or +40% if the advantages are overwhelming.\par
\b SEEKING AN EDGE:\b0  Instead of the usual roll to catch up or get away, pursuer or quarry may attempt to gain some advantage by testing a skill that applies to the situation.\par
\lang3081 Possible skills include Alertness, Navigate, Stealth, or Survival.\lang1033  \par
If this test wins the contest, instead of a \ldblquote win\rdblquote  it grants a +20% bonus to the next chase roll, or +40% with a critical success. Failure and fumbling have the usual effects.\par
\pard\b COMBAT DURING A CHASE:\b0  A person in a chase may be able to launch attacks at opponents, especially if their skill isn\rquote t being used as the test for escaping or evading (e.g., they are a passenger on a conveyance controlled by someone else). These will usually be some form of ranged attack. Such attacks are resolved \i before\i0  the pursuer and quarry roll to pursue and escape. Attacks use the \b COMBAT\b0  rules, beginning on page \lang3081 43\lang1033 . Each contest in the chase is equivalent to one combat turn. \par
If your Protagonist makes an attack but doing so \i will\i0  seriously impact their efforts to pursue or evade, the attack is considered to occur instead of a roll to pursue or escape \endash  effectively meaning the opponent\rquote s roll to pursue or escape automatically wins that exchange. This will always be the case if the pursuit is on foot; in other situations it will depend on whether your Protagonist\rquote s skill at controlling his or her conveyance is a major factor in the chase (if in doubt, the GM can make a call).\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 Willpower Points are mental fuel. Protagonists require Willpower Points to keep going despite exhaustion, to resist unwanted persuasion, to resist the effects of terror and mental disorders, and, on rare occasions, to resist or enact unnatural rituals.\par
\b LOW WILLPOWER POINTS:\b0  A Protagonist whose WP hits 1 or 2 has an emotional breakdown. The Protagonist suffers a \u8722?20% penalty to all actions until WP rises above 2.\par
\b RUNNING OUT OF WILLPOWER POINTS:\b0  A Protagonist at 0 WP loses all control. This can look different for every Protagonist and every situation. The Protagonist might collapse in wracking sobs, or lash out wildly, or simply pass out. The Game Moderator controls your Protagonist until WP returns to 1 or higher and describes the reaction. A Protagonist with 0 WP cannot succeed at \i any\i0  tests, including SAN tests. Sooner or later the Protagonist falls asleep, regardless of any disorders or stimulants, long enough to regain WP\par
\b REGAINING WILLPOWER POINTS:\b0  When your Protagonist gets a full night\rquote s sleep (but no more than once in a 24-hour period), he or she regains 1D6 WP. If you play up one of your Protagonist\rquote s personal motivations in a way the Game Moderator finds compelling, your Protagonist regains 1 WP.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 3.7.1\tab Exhaustion\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 A Protagonist who works too long or faces extreme danger and injury without resting becomes exhausted. When this comes into play is up to the Game Moderator, but a good rule of thumb is that going a night without sleep or refusing to rest after losing SAN or Hit Points leads to exhaustion.\par
An exhausted Protagonist suffers a \u8722?20% penalty to all skills, stat tests, and SAN tests, and loses 1D6 WP. The exhausted Protagonist loses another 1D6 WP after going another night without sleep, after working hard for a few hours, or after running or fighting for a few minutes. A full night\rquote s sleep cures exhaustion.\par
\b STIMULANTS:\b0  Taking common types of stimulants offsets the exhaustion penalty for 1D6 hours. Examples in the Jazz Age might include nicotine and caffeine.\par
Harder stimulants (if any are available) offset it for 2D6 hours. Examples in the Jazz Age include Benzedrine inhalers (the first mass-marketed amphetamine) and cocaine (snorted, declared illicit in many places).\par
During this time, your Protagonist can\rquote t sleep. A Protagonist can take more stimulants to keep going, but every dose after the first costs 1D6 WP.\par
\pard If your Protagonist gains a new mental disorder while using stimulants, the Game Moderator has good reason to say the disorder takes the form of addiction to them. (See \b DISORDERS\b0  on page \lang3081 70\lang1033 .)\lang3081\par

\pard\cf0\b0\f1 The first time your Protagonist tries to sleep after suffering temporary insanity or gaining a new mental disorder (see \b TEMPORARY INSANITY\b0  and \b DISORDERS\b0  on page \lang3081 68\lang1033 ), you must make a SAN test. If it fails, your Protagonist wakes in terror, losing the possibility of regaining any WP for 24 hours.\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\b ARTIFICIAL SEDATION:\b0  A Protagonist may try to overcome sleeplessness via artificial means, such as drinking alcohol or using other similar sedatives. This gives a +20% bonus to the SAN test to get to sleep. If the test fails, the Protagonist gets no rest despite taking sedatives. In addition, the Protagonist is sick the next day, at a \u8722?20% penalty to all tests until he or she gets a full night\rquote s rest. If your Protagonist gains a new mental disorder while using sedatives, the Game Moderator has good reason to say the disorder takes the form of an addiction to them.\par

The Game Moderator counts down by DEX for all characters, from highest to lowest. Each character acts when his or her number comes up. If DEX scores tie, the actions occur at the same time or the Game Moderator can choose some tiebreaker.\par

\pard Attacking with unarmed combat or a melee weapon (but not with weapon which acts at a distance) also means your Protagonist is parrying and blocking. See \b DEFENSE ROLLS\b0  on page \lang3081 47\lang1033  for details.\par

\lang3081 A called shot allows your Protagonist to roll a grenade past cover to explode on the far side, or to shoot someone in the leg and avoid body armor. If the attack is automatic gunfire that can hit multiple targets, the called shot affects only the first target.\lang1033\par

\b MOSTLY COVERED (\u8722?40%):\b0  The target is mostly covered (all but a limb or head).\par
\pard Making a called shot with unarmed combat or a melee weapon (but not with weapon which acts at a distance) also means your Protagonist is parrying and blocking. See \b DEFENSE ROLLS\b0  on page \lang3081 47\lang1033  for details.\par

If your roll overcomes the attack roll, your Protagonist avoids harm. See \b DEFENSE ROLLS\b0  on page \lang3081 47\lang1033  for details.

\pard\cf0\b0\f1 A roll to escape a pin. Roll either \b STR\'d75\b0  or \b Unarmed Combat\b0 , whichever is better. This acts as a defense roll against the character pinning your Protagonist (see \b DEFENSE ROLLS\b0  on page \lang3081 47\lang1033  for details); it\rquote s opposed by the pinning character\rquote s attack roll against your Protagonist. If the pinning character is not attacking, the escape is opposed by either \b Unarmed Combat\b0  or \b STR\'d75\b0  (whichever is better). If the escape roll succeeds, your Protagonist is no longer pinned \emdash  and the escape roll defends against other attacks until your Protagonist\rquote s next action.

Usually moving requires no roll, but if Protagonists are running or sprinting, players may need to make a \b DEX\'d75\b0  test to keep their footing. Fail, and your Protagonist falls prone and must spend a turn recovering.\par
\pard If there\rquote s cover at the end of your Protagonist\rquote s movement, getting behind it provides protection (see \b PROTECTION IN COMBAT\b0  on page \lang3081 53\lang1033 ).

\i All \i0 unarmed or melee weapon attacks against a pinned target are at a +20% bonus. A Protagonist pinning a target can attack the pinned target in later turns.\par
A pinned target can attempt escape once per turn (see the \b ESCAPE\b0  action, above) but nothing else.\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 Dodging and hand-to-hand combat (with unarmed or with melee weapons) are tests that protect your Protagonist by opposing an attack roll.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 4.3.1\tab Dodging and Fighting Back\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 Your Protagonist can Dodge or fight back against an incoming attack even before your Protagonist\rquote s DEX order in a turn. If you do this, it becomes your Protagonist\rquote s single action for that turn. A Protagonist who has already taken another action that turn can\rquote t Dodge or fight back until the next turn.\par
A roll to Dodge opposes \i all \i0 hand-to-hand attacks that turn. It lets your Protagonist duck behind cover to evade all ranged attacks that turn if cover is near. Dodging never inflicts damage.\par
Fighting back blocks \i all \i0 hand-to-hand attacks that turn. If you win the contest, you take no damage. It does not protect you against ranged attacks unless you\rquote re close enough to push the ranged weapon away. As part of your fighting back roll, choose one offensive action \endash  \b\caps attack, called shot, disarm,\b0\caps0  or \b\caps pin \b0\endash  \caps0 against a single attacker. If your roll beats that attacker\rquote s roll, your Protagonist takes no damage and your Protagonist\rquote s action affects the attacker.\par
In order to Dodge or fight back, your Protagonist must know an attack is coming and be physically able to block or evade it. If your Protagonist is pinned, if the attack occurs before he or she realizes it, or if your Protagonist can\rquote t see or hear the attacker, your Protagonist can\rquote t Dodge or fight back.\par

\lang3081 Nobody can react as fast as bullets and shrapnel, but your Protagonist can use Dodge to scramble for cover. If your Protagonist is near enough to move to cover and knows gunfire or an explosion is imminent, make a Dodge roll for the Protagonist to get behind the cover. If there\rquote s no cover, Dodging does no good. This is why people get nervous when guns come out.\lang1033\par

Your Protagonist can harm, disarm or pin only one target per turn (the attack might hurt others, but all attacks have a single target).\par
A roll to attack, disarm, pin, or make a called shot also opposes each \b Unarmed Combat\b0  and \b Melee Weapons\b0  attack against your Protagonist until your Protagonist\rquote s next action. If an attack fails to overcome your roll, it does no harm.\par
To oppose an attack, your Protagonist must know the attack is coming. That requires seeing or hearing the attacker. The Protagonist must \i also \i0 be physically able to block the attack, if it is melee. A pinned Protagonist can\rquote t defend, nor can a Protagonist who has already successfully pinned a target.\par

\pard\sa120\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 There are four types of healing: \i Resuscitation, Stabilization, Treatment, \i0 and \i Recuperation\i0 .\par
\b RESUSCITATION:\b0  Sometimes it\rquote s possible to resuscitate a dead character. If the Game Moderator says resuscitation is possible, someone must make a \b First Aid\b0  test. This must occur within a number of minutes after death equal to the victim\rquote s CON score. If it succeeds, it restores 1D4 HP (doubled for a critical success) and allows the patient to recover. If First Aid fails, the victim dies and may not be resuscitated.\par
\b STABILIZATION:\b0  Stabilizing a wounded character with a successful \b First Aid\b0  test immediately heals 1D4 HP. A critical success doubles the amount healed; a fumble \i inflicts \i0 1D4 damage. Once your Protagonist receives first aid, success or failure, the Protagonist can\rquote t benefit from it again until he or she suffers damage again.\par
\b TREATMENT:\b0  Treatment is professional care in a clean, calm location with extensive tools and healing supplies. \par
\lang3081 A doctor can attempt a Surgery or Medicine test once per week: Surgery for critical care of severe wounds; Medicine for poison, disease, and ongoing healing. If treatment succeeds, the patient recovers 1D4 HP. This is doubled with a critical, while a fumble inflicts 1D4 HP damage. At the Game Moderator\rquote s discretion, having worn-out tools or poor quality medicines may incur a penalty.\lang1033\par
\b RECUPERATION:\b0  Over time, the human body repairs itself. A patient who rests in a safe place with proper food and water can attempt a \b CON\'d75\b0  test once per day to recover 1 HP (in addition to any HP recovered due to medical treatment). On a critical success, the patient regains 1D4; on a fumble, the patient loses 1 HP.\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 Certain attacks inflict damage well beyond the possibility of survival\lang3081 ; a burst of heavy machine gun fire or an artillery shell makes fast work of human anatomy\lang1033 . Rather than rolling many dice for damage or many separate attacks, a weapon like this has a Lethality rating.\par
If an attack hits with a weapon that has a Lethality rating, there\rquote s a chance it simply kills the target outright. Instead of rolling normal damage, roll percentile dice against the weapon\rquote s Lethality rating. If the Lethality test succeeds, a human target immediately drops to 0 HP. If the Lethality test fails, add the two dice together as if they were individual D10s (0 is 10) and apply \i that \i0 as HP damage.\par
Lethality rolls do not fumble or critically succeed, but the attack roll can. If the attack roll is a critical success, double the Lethality rating, and double the HP damage if the Lethality roll fails.\par

If a weapon has a Kill Radius, a successful attack inflicts a Lethality roll on each character inside that radius. The center of the Kill Radius is the initial target of the attack.\par

Without it, a massively damaging attack might require several separate attacks and damage rolls to afflict many different targets. In the middle of combat, rolling that much breaks the tension. \par
If you\rquote d rather roll damage the old way, it\rquote s 1D6 damage for every 3% of Lethality. So a weapon with 35% would do 12D6 HP damage.\cell\row\pard\sb120\sa200\sl276\slmult1 With explosive weapons, Kill Radius attacks don\rquote t need to be as precise as ordinary attacks; hitting a zone within the Kill Radius of a target is enough. That adds +20% to the chance to hit.\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1 A failed attack roll means the Kill Radius lands harmlessly outside the intended area. The attack does no harm\emdash but may still suppress targets (see \b SUPPRESSION\b0 , below). Whether a failed Kill Radius attack does unwanted collateral damage is up to the Game Moderator.\par
\b MANY TARGETS:\b0  A single attack with a Kill Radius usually affects everyone in the Kill Radius. If that doesn\rquote t make sense for the situation, the Game Moderator can decide who gets hit.\par
The Game Moderator is welcome to let players roll the Lethality results for NPCs to speed things up. But really, you need to roll Lethality only for characters who are important enough to track in detail. Since even a failed Lethality roll inflicts between 2 and 20 damage, it\rquote s safe to just assume that most humans caught in a Kill Radius are either dead or incapacitated.\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 Some small arms, like submachine guns and assault rifles, have selective fire. The shooter chooses how it\rquote s used; each pull of the trigger can fire a single shot, a short burst, a long burst, a short spray, or a long spray. A weapon set for single shots attacks normally. A burst or a spray has a Lethality rating.\par
A short burst fires three bullets in one trigger pull. It affects a single target. A long burst fires five shots with a Kill Radius of 1 yard. Short and long sprays empty the magazine faster, but cover a larger Kill Radius. Some firearms allow only single shots or short bursts (\ldblquote three-round bursts\rdblquote ). \par

\pard\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 If your Protagonist wants to disable or destroy a structure or vehicle, an explosive or other form of Lethal attack might be their best bet. Such large objects have their own Hit Points (see \b VEHICLES,\b0  page \lang3081 64\lang1033 ), and they are considered huge targets (see \b HUGE\b0 , page \lang3081 54\lang1033 ).\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1 For example, if your Protagonist wanted to gain entry into a bank vault, he or she might try lobbing a hand grenade at its door. The GM might rule that the safe has 20HP and an Armor rating of 10. Assuming the grenade lands such that the safe is within its kill radius (10 yards from where it lands), the safe will take damage. Because the object is treated like a HUGE target, the normal Lethality 15% damage is translated into an automatic 15 HP damage reduced by Armor down to 5 HP. So, while the explosion makes a lot of noise, the safe is only a quarter broken into. Time to get some more grenades.\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 Being involved in combat is inherently frightening for most people. However, certain types of attacks which devastate an entire area are especially terror-inducing. When faced with such destruction \endash  whether from a mundane weapon (e.g., \lang3081 a burst from a Tommy gun\lang1033 ) or something supernatural \endash  primal instinct kicks in to prevent a person from placing themselves in mortal peril.\par
The GM can nominate that any massively damaging attack is \b Terror-Inducing.\b0  Any character who knowingly seeks to enter a region targeted by such an attack will hesitate and go to ground \endash  \i even if the attack does not succeed\i0 . The only way to stifle this primal terror is by voluntarily sacrificing 1 SAN.\par
The types of attacks which might be ruled Terror-Inducing include:\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f2\'b7\tab\f1 Attacks (mundane or supernatural) that inflict Lethal Damage to a Kill Zone,\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 Attacks which have previously been witnessed to inflict Unnatural effects worthy of a SAN test,\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 Anything else the GM believes would strike extreme fear into combatants.\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1 Note that these effects do not apply to a combatant who is not aware that he or she is straying into an area targeted by the Terror-Inducing attack \endash  when in doubt, call for an \b Alertness\b0  test.\par
\pard A character adapted to violence (see \b ADAPTING TO SAN LOSS\b0  on page \lang3081 74\lang1033 ) loses no SAN for braving a Terror-Inducing attack. For NPCs, it\rquote s easiest to assume the average human goes to ground when faced with such attacks. Only insane, hardened, or fanatical enemies stand up to such intense fear.\par

What if several combatants team up to concentrate simultaneous shots \endash  none of which themselves are Terror-Inducing \endash  on a single point? In such a case the GM might decide that the combined effect is sufficient to create 1 yard-radius circular zone centered on the point of concentrated fire. All combatants firing at the spot make an attack roll \endash  if the majority succeed, no damage is inflicted but the designated zone is treated as Terror-Inducing. If one or more of the attackers scored a critical on their roll, a random target in the zone is hit for normal damage \i and\i0  everyone else in the zone is affected by the Terror effect. If fewer than half of the attackers succeeded on their rolls, no damage is inflicted \i and\i0  no terror is generated.\par
\pard\intbl\sl276\slmult1 As a rule of thumb, for a concentration of smaller attacks to be ruled as creating a Terror-Inducing effect the sum of their individual maximum damages should be at least 30HP (i.e., three attacks each delivering 1D10 or five attacks each delivering 1D6).

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\i\f1 Exposed \i0 is the default for humans and many creatures. It means the target is aware of danger and trying to avoid it, but doesn\rquote t have any real protection. Attacks operate normally against Exposed targets.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 4.9.3\tab Armored\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 Being \i Armored \i0 reduces the damage of attacks. Armor has an Armor rating which reduces the HP damage of attacks. Armor 5 means reduce damage by 5.\par
Armor comes in two forms: \i body armor \i0 and \i cover\i0 . They both reduce the damage of ordinary attacks, but have different effects on Lethality attacks. If you have more than one source of armor (such as wearing body armor while behind a wall), add them all together.\par
\pard Some weapons are armor piercing, which in turn reduces armor (see \b ARMOR PIERCING WEAPONS\b0 , page \lang3081 54\lang1033 ). Furthermore, damage arising from wholly supernatural effects (e.g., mystical energy or psychic attacks by Mythos entities, or damage generated through rituals) completely ignores all armor. In cases where it isn\rquote t clear whether traditional armor should protect against damage dealt through otherworldly means, it is the GM\rquote s call.\par
\b BODY ARMOR:\b0  Body armor reduces the damage of an ordinary attack by its Armor Rating. Body armor protects against the damage of a failed Lethality roll, but does nothing whatsoever against a \i successful \i0 Lethality roll.\par
\b COVER:\b0  Finding cover means using a hard barrier as armor against attack. Cover protects more completely than body armor. If you have cover against a Lethality attack, the Lethality roll automatically fails, but still inflicts the sum of the dice as damage. Subtract the cover\rquote s Armor rating from that damage.\par
What if your Protagonists are completely enclosed in a structure or conveyance? That\rquote s definitely cover, but it\rquote s the Game Moderator\rquote s call. Maybe they take damage reduced by the cover, or maybe they take no damage until the cover is breached.\par
Being behind cover does not make Protagonists immune to the terror of combat (see \b FEAR IN COMBAT\b0  on page \lang3081 52\lang1033 ). If your Protagonist is terrorized, his or her next action must be to hide behind that cover instead of attacking.\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 An armor piercing weapon reduces the Armor value of a target by a number of points. If the weapon description notes it as armor-piercing it will normally also specify the reduction \endash  if no number is given, assume the attack reduces effective armor by 5.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s2\fi-576\li576\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0\fs26 4.10\tab Optional Spot Rules for Weapons\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 There\rquote s a staggering variety of personal firearms and weaponry. Their usefulness in adventures may be limited, of course, depending on who or what the Protagonists face.\par
\pard The primary game statistics relating to different types of weapons may be found on the Example Weapons Table on page \lang3081 49\lang1033 . The availability of any class of weapon will be dictated by the scarcity of weapon resources in the particular game setting (see preceding section). \par
What follows are some spot rules for Protagonists who have access to common Jazz Age (early 20\super th\nosupersub  Century) weapons. \par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 4.10.1\tab Concealing Weapons\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 Knives and pistols can be concealed under ordinary clothing. Someone deliberately looking for a concealed weapon can attempt an \b Alertness\b0  test to spot it. A heavy pistol or especially big knife means a +20% Alertness bonus.\par
If a Protagonist is wearing an overcoat or trench coat, he or she can attempt to conceal a bigger gun like a sawed-off shotgun, or a larger hand weapon (e.g., a hatchet or machete) and incur no Alertness bonus.\par
There\rquote s no way to conceal a full-size rifle or a large melee weapon.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 4.10.2\tab Hand-to-Hand Weapons\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 Unarmed attacks, like punching, kicking, and strangling, use the \b Unarmed\b0  Combat skill. All melee weapons use the \b Melee Weapons\b0  skill.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 4.10.3\tab Primitive Ranged Weapons\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 Old-fashioned ranged weapons that are aimed (e.g., crossbows, bow, and slings) use the \b Firearms\b0  skill even though they aren\rquote t firearms. All such weapons require some kind of ammunition (arrows, bolts, bow) and are useless if the supply is exhausted. Primitive weapons that are thrown (e.g., spears) use \b Athletics\b0  skill.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 4.10.4\tab Firearms\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 Depending on when and where the game is set, the Protagonists may have easy access to a range of different firearms.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s4\sb40\sl276\slmult1\cf1\i\f0 Pistols\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\i0\f1 Lightweight pistols fire low-powered cartridges and are of limited use even against humans. Medium pistols are the standard sidearms in the military everywhere. They fire moderately powerful rounds. Most revolvers hold six shots, but some late models hold seven or eight. Pocket revolvers sometimes take only five. There\rquote s a huge variety of ammunition capacities for semiautomatic pistol magazines, but 15 is typical, although 17 or even 20 is not uncommon. Large-caliber pistols often carry less. A typical figure for a heavy pistol is eight.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s4\sb40\sl276\slmult1\cf1\i\f0 Shotguns\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\i0\f1 A typical pump-action shotgun holds five shots, although there are many with extended magazines for eight or more. Double-barrel shotguns hold one shot per barrel and can fire both barrels at one target with one attack roll. Shotguns can fire shot (a spread of small projectiles), slugs (a single heavy bullet), or \ldblquote non-lethal\rdblquote  ammunition such as salt-loaded cartridges.\par
\pard\b FIRING SHOT:\b0  Grants a +20% bonus to hit at all ranges: at point-blank due to the target being so close (see \b ATTACK MODIFIERS\b0  on page \lang3081 46\lang1033 ) and beyond that due to the spread of projectiles. If the target has an Armor rating due to armor or cover, double it.\par
\b FIRING BOTH BARRELS:\b0  You can fire both barrels of a double-barrel shotgun at one target with one attack roll. That inflicts an extra +1D8 damage at base range. It adds no damage beyond base range as the shot or the slugs separate.\par
\b OTHER GAUGES:\b0  These rules assume a standard 12-gauge (called 12-bore in England) shotgun. Modify the damage by +2 for a heavier bore or \u8722?2 for a lighter gauge.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s4\sb40\sl276\slmult1\cf1\i\f0 Tommy Guns\par
\pard\cf0\i0\f1 Thompson submachine guns (nicknamed \ldblquote Trench brooms\rdblquote  and \ldblquote Chicago Typewriters\rdblquote ) fire full-automatic bursts but are often also capable of semi-automatic fire. When firing semi-automatic, the weapon inflicts ordinary damage; with automatic fire, it uses a Lethality rating (see \b LETHALITY RATING\b0  on page \lang3081 49\lang1033 ).\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s4\sb40\sl276\slmult1\cf1\i\f0 Rifles and Carbines\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\i0\f1 Rifles fire more powerful cartridges than pistols, for better penetration, wounding, and range. However, they are also bulkier. \par
Rifles in the Jazz Age are mostly breach loading, bolt-action weapons. These must be manually worked before each shot, which delays aiming. An attack using such a weapon in the turn immediately after it\rquote s already been fired is at \u8722?20%. A rifle gets no benefit from the \b Aim\b0  action in the turn immediately after it\rquote s fired.\par

\b EXPRESS BULLETS (HOLLOW POINT):\b0  Late in the 19\super th\nosupersub  Century these bullets were marketed as cartridges that were lighter weight \endash  since they were hollow at the tip \endash  thereby increasing velocity. They also proved to cause greater tissue trauma, albeit at the expense of penetration. An Express (hollow point) bullet does +1 damage but armor is twice as effective against it. Express bullets were originally designed for rifles, but were also produced for larger-caliber pistols.\cell\row\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 Many unnatural things that Protagonists face are inscrutable perversions of physics no more vulnerable to explosions than they are to crucifixes. This never stops Protagonists from trying.\par
The Base Range for WW1 Machineguns reflects the fact that it needs to be accurate enough only to get a target within the Kill Radius. Such weapons fired off their tripod mounts halve Base Range.\par
Naval Guns and Field Guns are specialized pieces of equipment that require some form of Military Training at 40%+ to operate in a moderately safe fashion. They also require the concerted work of a whole team of trained military personnel. The specific skill tests needed to accurately target a Mythos horror with one of these weapons should be determined by the GM based on the specific situation. Conceivably a hit by a shell launched by a large bore gun could deal Lethality 25% across a Kill Zone of 8 yards radius. A fumble or misfire could be just as devastating to the team operating the weapon.\par

\pard\cf0\i0\f1 These terrifying forms of chemical warfare were commonly used by both sides in World War 1. Exposure to such gas creates horrific damage that is best dealt with as a form of poisoning. See the table on page \lang3081 57\lang1033 . Military gas masks are an effective, if bulky, defense but anyone wearing such a mask suffers a \u8722?20% penalty to \b Alertness\b0  and \b Search\b0  tests.\par

\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 4.11.1\tab Poison and Disease\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 Every poison or disease has two ratings: \i Speed \i0 and \i Damage\i0 .\par
\i Speed \i0 indicates how soon the poison or disease inflicts damage. A poison inflicts damage once and then passes from your Protagonist\rquote s system. A disease requires a series of CON tests to resist damage.\par
\i Damage \i0 is ordinary HP for a disease, while poisons have Lethality ratings.\par
\b POISONS:\b0  A poison has a Lethality rating. If the Lethality roll fails, the victim makes a CON\'d75 test to withstand harm. Success means half damage, and a critical success means the victim loses only 1 HP. A fumble doubles the damage. \lquote Hospitalization\rquote  (makeshift or otherwise) grants +20% to the victim\rquote s CON test.\par
\b DISEASES:\b0  Diseases inflict HP damage. If your Protagonist succeeds at a CON\'d75 test, he or she suffers half damage and recovers from the disease. On a failure, he or she suffers full damage and must make the CON\'d75 test again after another Speed interval. A fumbled CON test doubles the damage. While under the effects of a disease, the Protagonist cannot gain Hit Points back. \lquote Hospitalization\rquote  grants a +20% bonus to the CON test. Serious diseases may come with a penalty to the CON test.\par

But every time the Protagonist is badly hurt (losing more than half his or her HP) or suffers from some other poison or disease, the Protagonist must make a CON\'d75 test to resist a resurgence.\par
\lang3081 ANTIDOTES: A few poisons and diseases can be cured with medication. If a physician has the antidote for a poison or the right drug to treat a disease, a Medicine test before the ailment takes effect renders the poison or disease harmless.

\pard\cf0\b0\f1 Falling is extremely dangerous to humans. Even a bad slip can be lethal. A fall from a short distance (one to three yards) does 1D6 damage, or 2D6 if it\rquote s a particularly uncontrolled fall. Beyond that, a fall instead has a Lethality rating of 1% per yard fallen. A Protagonist who survives a fall must make a \b CON\'d75\b0  test or be \b STUNNED\b0  (see page \lang3081 48\lang1033 ).\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 Suffocation is a slow death. If your Protagonist takes a deep breath before holding it, he or she can go without breathing for CON\'d75 turns. After that, your Protagonist\rquote s oxygen-starved brain begins to die. Once every turn, make a \b CON\'d75\b0  test. If it fails, your Protagonist suffers 1D6 HP damage. If the CON test succeeds, your Protagonist suffers 1 HP damage instead. This continues until your Protagonist can breathe again or he or she dies.\par
If your Protagonist doesn\rquote t get a breath before suffocating, the damage starts immediately and lasts until someone clears his or her airway with a \b First Aid\b0  test. Armor does not protect against suffocation damage.\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 Some items that the Protagonists want to obtain might not be easy to obtain \endash  either because they are restricted in some way, especially scarce, or illegal. Alternatively, the items might be available, but priced such that the Protagonist simply can\rquote t afford them. In such situations, the only recourse might be to scrounge around to see if the items can be \lquote liberated\rquote  from somewhere. This might involve sifting through discarded items to find pieces that are good enough to function as needed, and perhaps lashing them together to make more complex equipment.\par
If a Protagonist wants to obtain a resource that isn\rquote t available to them via simple means, there are two ways:\par
\pard\fi-360\li765\sa200\sl276\slmult1 1.\tab By rummaging through the stockpile of belongings that constitute his or her personal \lquote resources\rquote , or\par
2.\tab Searching the environment to try to locate an abandoned or unclaimed supply of that resource.\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1 Each of these methods uses a different game mechanic. \par
The former is a use of the Protagonist\rquote s \b Resources\b0  rating, while the latter is a use of his or her \lang3081\b Search\lang1033\b0  skill.\par
In both cases, the difficulty of the test to locate a usable item depends on the scarcity of the item being sought, as well as:\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f2\'b7\tab\b\f1 [For rummaging the resource pool]\b0  \endash  whether the item is small enough to realistically be carried around from place to place.\par
\f2\'b7\tab\b\f1 [For scavenging] \endash\b0  whether the location being searched is a likely or unlikely place for such resources to have been stored or abandoned.\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1 The results of a test can indicate that an item has been discovered, or describe utter failure of the search/rummaging. However even if the roll is successful there is no guarantee that the resource discovered will be in good condition \endash  the discovered item might be heavily worn or maybe even utter junk (see box nearby).\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 As an abstraction, the scarcity of a resource in the game setting can be rated on the following scale (from least to most scarce):\par

\pard\keep\keepn\s2\fi-576\li576\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0\fs26 5.3\tab The Fine Art of Jury-Rigging\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 Protagonists may often find themselves faced with an inability to track down the exact equipment or devices that they really need to get something done. No amount of scrounging or rummaging through each person\rquote s resources pool will track down the obscure item they need. What can a Protagonist group do in that situation? One option is to devise a plan to hunt down a collection of less-scarce component items and cobble together some kind of hodge-podge out of the parts. This is the fine art of jury-rigging.\par
In \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0 , all attempts to build these kinds of lash-ups are governed by \lang3081\b Craft skill specializations or Use Gadgets (at the GM's discretion)\lang1033\b0 . \par
The players should describe exactly what they plan to construct and what components they hope to use. Ideally there should be some kind of logic or rationale behind why such items might come together in the way imagined, but ultimately it is up to you as Game Moderator to decide whether the planned jury-rigged device has any chance of working.\par
Once the plan is made, choose a scarcity for each component parts \endash  hopefully somewhat better than the scarcity of the original item \endash  and the Protagonists can venture forth (or rummage around their resource pools) to see if they can find all the pieces they need. Once they have each part, one or more skill tests will be needed to successfully assemble the final item or device.\par
\pard At best, a lash-up created in this way qualities as a \lquote heavily worn\rquote  version of the real item or device. If any discovery rolls along the way yielded up sub-standard parts, or the skill rolls were only marginally successful, you might decide the lash-up is barely-functional \lquote junk\rquote  (see \b PRE-LOVED ITEMS AND SPOILED GOODS\b0  on page \lang3081 61\lang1033 ).\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 Depending on the nature of the game setting, different types of simple or sophisticated vehicles might be common items. If the Protagonists or their adversary have access to such vehicles, the following guidelines may assist when dangerous and/or action-oriented scenes involving vehicles arise during play.\par
Vehicles have three basic statistics:\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f2\'b7\tab\b\f1 Hit Points\b0  and \b Armor\b0 , in case they\rquote re involved in combat, and \par

\pard\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 Each vehicle counts as a Huge target (see \b HUGE\b0 , page \lang3081 54\lang1033 ). It takes damage from unarmed attacks and small weapons such as knives and clubs only when the Game Moderator thinks it makes sense.\par
A vehicle that loses \b half\b0  its Hit Points is badly damaged. It can\rquote t be operated without a relevant skill test (depending on the type of vehicle). The next time such a test \i fumbles\i0 , the vehicle fails altogether until repaired. Repairing a damaged vehicle requires time, parts, and successful application of one or more skill tests. Even if repaired, the vehicle might now qualify as \lquote heavily worn\rquote  or \lquote junk\rquote  (see \b\caps Pre-Loved Items and Spoiled Goods\b0\caps0 , page \lang3081 61\lang1033 ).\par
A vehicle that loses \i all\i0  of its Hit Points is demolished. It will never function again.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 6.1.1\tab Speed\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 There are two broad categories of vehicle speed: Surface and Air. Any vehicle with an Air Speed rating can automatically outrun a vehicle with a Surface Speed rating (except for Hot Air Balloons, which can\rquote t outrun any vehicle, and Zeppelins which are considered equivalent speed to a Slow Surface vehicle).\par
Within the same vehicle category, some are faster than others. A vehicle with a \lquote Fast\rquote  rating grants a +20% bonus to any \b Drive\b0  or \b Pilot\b0  test to pursue or escape. A \lquote Slow\rquote  vehicle incurs a \u8722?20% penalty instead. An \lquote Average\rquote  rating confers no modifier.\par
A vehicle that\rquote s notorious for poor handling or that\rquote s in bad shape might counts as \lquote heavily worn\rquote  or \lquote junk\rquote  (see above) at the GM\rquote s discretion.\par

\b AT LOW SPEED:\b0  1D6 or 2D6 damage. \par

\b AT HIGH SPEED:\b0  roll the vehicle\rquote s maximum HP as a Lethality rating. \par
If the target is a huge creature or another vehicle, the ramming vehicle suffers half ramming damage based on the target\rquote s HP. \par
A vehicle\rquote s Armor rating acts as Armor Piercing for its ramming damage. \par
Every passenger in a ramming vehicle takes 1D6 damage. Every passenger in a rammed vehicle takes 2D6 damage. A worn seat belt halves the damage. A passenger in a vehicle that rams a target less than huge size suffers no damage.\lang3081\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 Sanity Points represent the resilience of \cf3 the relationship between your Protagonist\rquote s personality and the world. With high SAN, your Protagonist has confidence in his or her place in the world. A high SAN score is marked by insight, self-awareness, and a life-affirming view of reality. With low SAN, the deadly truth of the universe has begun to overwhelm your Protagonist. With no SAN, your Protagonist is forever lost.\par
\pard Unlike the protagonists in many tabletop roleplaying games, \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0  Protagonists may begin play with a level of mental scarring due to the harshness of their upbringing. This scarring can manifest itself in different ways \endash  reduced starting SAN, mental disorders, or adaptation to traumatic stimuli. The Protagonist creations rules outline mechanics for determining this psychological damage (\b\caps Mental Damage from Harsh UPBRINGINGs\b0\caps0 , page \lang3081 36\lang1033 ).\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf3\b0\f1\fs22 When your Protagonist faces a threat to sanity, make a SAN test: roll his or her current SAN or lower of 1D100 to take a diminished loss of SAN points; roll higher than your Protagonist\rquote s SAN and he or she suffers a greater loss of SAN points.\par
Sanity losses look like: 0/1D4 or 1D6/1D20. The number on the left is how much SAN your Protagonist loses on a successful SAN test; the one on the right is how much SAN your Protagonist loses on a failed test.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s2\fi-576\li576\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0\fs26 7.2\tab Rules of Thumb for SAN Loss\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 If the cost of failing a SAN test is 1D6 or less, the cost of success is usually zero. If the cost of failure is 1D8 or 1D10, the cost of success is usually 1. Some unnatural events and encounters are even more catastrophic.\par
A critical success with a Sanity roll means your Protagonist loses the least possible SAN. If the loss for succeeding at the Sanity roll would have been 1D4, he or she loses 1 point. \par
Fumbling a Sanity roll means your Protagonist loses the most possible SAN. If the loss for failing the Sanity roll would have been 1D20, he or she loses 20 points.\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 When your Protagonist loses SAN, take a second to describe it. If the Protagonist loses a few points, how does that look to the people around him or her? Does the Protagonist jump or cry out in terror? Does the Protagonist stare in shock? Does the Protagonist back away involuntarily? If your Protagonist kills someone and loses no SAN, what does that say about the Protagonist?\par
What are the long-term effects of repeatedly losing SAN? What strong beliefs or motivations are eroding as your Protagonist\rquote s SAN falls? The game is more potent when you play out those details and let them shape your Protagonist.\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 The three major threats to SAN are \i Violence\i0 , \i Helplessness \i0 and the \i Unnatural\i0 .\par
These categories can overlap. Being tied up and tortured might trigger both Violence and Helplessness. It\rquote s up to the Game Moderator to decide which aspects affects the Protagonist.\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 Killing other humans is inherently harmful to sanity. While wrestling and punching people is within biological norms, bludgeoning someone to death is not instinctive. Violence can drive you insane if you\rquote re not careful.\par
In combat, you must make a SAN test for a trauma \i the first time it happens in that fight\i0 . Outside of combat, every individual incident triggers its own SAN loss.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 7.4.2\tab Helplessness\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 The essential human impulse is to act. True inactivity is unwholesome to the human psyche.\par
Note that helplessness often makes violence worse, just like violence makes helplessness worse.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 7.4.3\tab The Unnatural\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 Finally there\rquote s the unnatural, the inhuman things of the Cthulhu Mythos that haunt the edges of existence. The unnatural troubles us because it is wholly outside of human experience. It wounds our sense of connection to the world by causing huge gaps in understanding.\par
This is why your Unnatural skill limits maximum SAN. The more you understand of mankind\rquote s \i actual \i0 position in the cosmos, the harder it is to navigate in the \lquote real\rquote  world.\par
If a Protagonist faces the Unnatural and loses 0 SAN, it may mean the Protagonist has adapted to the reality of the Unnatural in some small way \emdash  or it may mean simple denial, refusing to admit the Unnatural experience was real. It\rquote s up to the player.\par

\pard\cf0\b0\f1 Your Protagonist must move away from the SAN-affecting stimulus at top speed in any direction.

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 This is shutting down or passing out from shock. If conscious, your Protagonist is catatonic and paralyzed until the Game Moderator decides he or she snaps out of it. When your Protagonist comes to, it\rquote s likely he or she has suppressed the trauma that caused his or her collapse. Remembering details requires an \b INT\'d75\b0  test and is terribly stressful.

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 Whenever your Protagonist goes temporarily insane or develops a disorder due to an encounter with the Unnatural, he or she also gains some deeper understanding of the true nature of reality. \par
If your Protagonist had no prior knowledge of the Cthulhu Mythos (i.e., has an Unnatural skill rating of 0), such an experience causes him or her to gain +5 percentiles in the Unnatural skill. Even if they already knew about the Unnatural, such an experience grants a further +1 percentile to the Unnatural skill. \par
This increase also serves to reduce the Protagonist\rquote s maximum SAN (and if current SAN is higher than this value, also causes it to drop to the new maximum).\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 A Protagonist whose SAN reaches the Breaking Point gains a disorder. When suffering from a disorder, the mind maladapts to mental trauma with long-term neuroses. A disorder is like a release valve for intolerable stress. Indulging in it helps your Protagonist cope. It\rquote s possible to suffer from multiple disorders at the same time.\par
Any disorder is negative in the long term, but some are worse than others. Whatever the source of the disorder, it takes the form of an irrational adaptation to the trauma that produced it. It may manifest a few hours after the trauma, or it might take days, weeks, or months to appear. The player and the Game Moderator negotiate the exact nature of your Protagonist\rquote s psychological trauma, so it makes sense. If your Protagonist saw his or her partner die in a fire, developing \i pyrophobia \i0 makes sense for example.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 7.7.1\tab Acute Episodes\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 A disorder is a chronic, ongoing condition. It lurks under the surface, threatening to erupt when things get bad. Each disorder suggests triggers that bring on acute episodes. Acute episodes last as long as your Protagonist is in the crisis or in the presence of the trigger and usually for at least a few hours afterward. In an acute episode, the Protagonist succumbs to the disorder\rquote s internal logic and must act accordingly. If your Protagonist suffers from more than one disorder, the Game Moderator decides which comes to the fore.\par
\pard\b REPRESSING AN EPISODE:\b0  When an acute episode begins, your Protagonist can attempt to repress it by projecting the stress and trauma onto a Bond. See \b USING BONDS TO REPRESS INSANITY\b0  on page \lang3081 75\lang1033 .\par
\b EFFECTS OF AN EPISODE:\b0  Suffering an acute episode of a disorder often means your Protagonist can\rquote t take some actions (or can attempt them only with a penalty), or your Protagonist \i must \i0 take some actions. The Game Moderator always decides the exact repercussions, and whether it happens immediately or builds gradually, in the aftermath of the trauma.\par
When your Protagonist is going through an acute episode, make sure it is obvious to everyone that something is wrong. \par
An \b Insight\b0  roll can diagnose your Protagonist\rquote s particular disorder.\par
It may be possible for someone to talk your Protagonist down despite the crisis or the presence of the trigger, reducing the impact of the disorder so the Protagonist can regain self-control. That takes a few minutes.\par

These are, at best, short-term remedies and come with their own negative impacts.\par
Taking a powerful sedative (e.g., a barbiturate like veronal) gives your Protagonist a +20% bonus to resist an acute episode of a disorder at the cost of a \u8722?20% penalty to everything else. Using such drugs frequently makes addiction to them a likely result of your Protagonist\rquote s next disorder. If that happens, the drugs no longer confer any bonus to reduce acute episodes of a disorder, but still inflict the penalty.\par
Heavy drinking (where alcohol is available), psychedelics or cannabis gives your Protagonist a +10% bonus to resist an acute episode at the same \u8722?20% penalty to other actions. Alcohol runs the risk of addiction.\cell\row\pard\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 There are many adaptations the mind makes when exposed to traumatic events, whether they be violence and gore, feelings of utter helplessness, or the inherent \lquote wrongness\rquote  of unnatural Cthulhu Mythos beings. The specific disorder received by a Protagonist should never be a random roll on a table, but something specifically selected to relate to the trauma they suffered.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s4\sb40\sl276\slmult1\cf1\i\f0 Addiction (e.g., Alcoholism, Cocainism, Morphinism)\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\i0\f1 Your Protagonist relies on a harmful habit or substance to get by. However much harm the addiction causes, your Protagonist needs the relief it offers. Losing 2+ SAN in any single roll triggers an acute episode, an overwhelming need. Feeding it usually imparts a \u8722?20% penalty to stats and skills for a few hours due to intoxication or distraction. And even in the best of times, going 24 hours without feeding the addiction costs 1D6 WP and prevents your Protagonist from recovering any WP. Every further 24 hours costs 1D6 WP. At 2 or fewer WP, your Protagonist does irrational, self-destructive things to feed the addiction.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s4\sb40\sl276\slmult1\cf1\i\f0 Amnesia\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\i0\f1 This is a common disorder from encounters with the unnatural. Losing 2+ SAN in any single roll triggers an acute episode, which erases all memory of the episode until your Protagonist finds a way to bring it back.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s4\sb40\sl276\slmult1\cf1\i\f0 Hysterical Condition of Blindness / Deafness / Paralysis\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\i0\f1 Collectively called conversion disorder, this can manifest either as non\u8208?physical blindness, deafness, or paralysis (pick one). Losing 2+ SAN in any single roll triggers an acute episode, which leaves your Protagonist blind, deaf, or paralyzed with numbness and tremors until the source of stress goes away.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s4\sb40\sl276\slmult1\cf1\i\f0 Mania\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\i0\f1 Your Protagonist displays a euphoric and perhaps irritable mood that is consistently present. This may include frenzied activity for no obvious reason, uncharacteristic garrulousness, a random stream\u8208?of\u8208?consciousness flow of ideas, or difficulty sleeping. An acute episode is triggered whenever your Protagonist loses 2+ SAN in a single roll. During an acute episode all tasks which require concentration or fine control are at \b one\u8208?fifth chance.\b0\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s4\sb40\sl276\slmult1\cf1\i\f0 Megalomania / Narcissistic\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\i0\f1 What does it mean to look upon the face of a dead god and live? Some see themselves as messiahs, or as exempt from ordinary morality. Losing 2+ SAN in any single roll triggers an acute episode, in which every hint of doubt about your Protagonist\rquote s superiority fills him or her with indignation. That causes every use of a stat or skill to get help or make a good impression to fail.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s4\sb40\sl276\slmult1\cf1\i\f0 Melancholia\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\i0\f1 Acute melancholia means total despair and a crushing inability to get anything done. It sometimes takes the shape of overwhelming guilt. An acute episode is triggered by reminders of past traumas your Protagonist suffered or inflicted, which can come in the most surprising forms and moments. During an acute episode, every skill or stat test costs 1D4 WP.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s4\sb40\sl276\slmult1\cf1\i\f0 Multiplex Personalities\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\i0\f1 Most of the time, your Protagonist seems fine. Suffering temporary insanity or reaching the Breaking Point triggers an acute episode, in which your Protagonist takes on an alternate identity with its own personality and memories. Over time, more identities may surface. The Game Moderator decides when and whether you keep control of your Protagonist\rquote s behavior.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s4\sb40\sl276\slmult1\cf1\i\f0 Obsession / Monomania\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\i0\f1 Your Protagonist becomes fixated on some person, place, event, act, or idea. Losing 2+ SAN in any single roll triggers an acute episode, which lasts days. In that time, any long-term action or skill use\emdash anything taking more than a few hours\emdash is at \u8722?20% because your Protagonist\rquote s mind is so often wrapped around its obsession.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s4\sb40\sl276\slmult1\cf1\i\f0 Paranoia\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\i0\f1 A delusional state of \i Dementia Praecox\i0  (disrupted cognitive function) commonly presenting as extreme suspicion, in which a fear of invisible enemies pervades one\rquote s world-view. Losing 2+ SAN in any single roll triggers an acute episode. Unless your Protagonist finds a way to stifle his or her delusions, he or she can\rquote t trust or rely on anyone. Every event, every disagreement or source of suspicion is a clue to a conspiracy against the Protagonist.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s4\sb40\sl276\slmult1\cf1\i\f0 Phobia or Philia\par
\pard\cf0\i0\f1 A common affliction arising from traumatic experiences is the development of an irrational fear of something related (directly or by association) with the incident. These are called phobias and can be quite debilitating. Whenever a Protagonist is in the presence of a trigger for his or her phobia, he or she must make a \b SAN\b0  test (even if the trigger is not terrifying in any way to others). Failure means an acute episode has been triggered, during which there\rquote s little choice but to suffer the Flee or Submit response to temporary insanity (see page \lang3081 69\lang1033 ). A nearby box provides some examples of phobias; searching online will reveal a huge array of other (sometimes quite weird) phobias.\par
A less common response to experiencing something shocking is the development of an irrational fetish or allure for something odd that is associated with the situation (perhaps which somehow related to the Protagonist\rquote s survival). These are called philias and work in a similar way to phobias in that whenever the afflicted Protagonist is in the presence of his or her irrational fetish a \b SAN\b0  roll is required to maintain any degree of self\u8208?control.\lang3081  \lang1033 If failed, an acute episode results during which the Game Moderator will dictate your Protagonist\rquote s actions until he or she regains control.  The list of phobias shown nearby can be converted into philias by simply inverting them: for example, where scotophobia is a fear of darkness, scotophilia is an obsessive and irrational predisposition to shroud oneself in darkness.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s4\sb40\sl276\slmult1\cf1\i\f0 Psychogenic Fugue\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\i0\f1 Your Protagonist may shut down into catatonia or wander off in an unconnected daze. It often manifests in the face of emotional or personal complications. Suffering temporary insanity or reaching the Breaking Point triggers an acute episode during which your Protagonist may disappear for days at a time, returning with no memory of his or her recent past.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s4\sb40\sl276\slmult1\cf1\i\f0 Schizoid\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\i0\f1 Your Protagonist\rquote s personality changes towards an uncharacteristic emotionlessness. He or she will be perceived as cold or aloof by most people. This can have a devastating effect on interpersonal relationships. In game terms, all personal interaction skill tests or \b CHA\b0  tests are halved at any time. Whenever your Protagonist loses 2+ SAN on any single roll, he or she suffers an acute episode during which the emotionlessness amplifies to the point where CHA tests must be made at \b one\u8208?fifth\b0  chance. Such episodes usually last a few days.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s4\sb40\sl276\slmult1\cf1\i\f0 Shellshock\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\i0\f1 A common diagnosis for individuals who have encountered extraordinarily traumatic condition in the trenches of the Great War (being shelled), although it may equally well arise from other exposures to exceptionally stressful situations where a terribly traumatic encounter leaves its scars upon someone. If afflicted by \ldblquote shellshock\rdblquote  your Protagonist is frequently haunted by glimpses of traumatic events he or she witnessed in the past \endash  these create anxiety and make it hard to achieve restful sleep. An acute episode is triggered by reminders of past traumas your Protagonist suffered or inflicted. In an acute episode, the Game Moderator chooses one effect: your Protagonist either reacts violently to threats only the Protagonist perceives, or suffers an acute depressive episode.

Protagonists at 0 SAN have embraced a world of violence, helplessness, and death. No therapy or treatment will ever bring them back.\par
It remains up to the Game Moderator to determine when the Protagonist is \lquote removed\rquote  from play. Sometimes it is instant; after the SAN loss, the Protagonist collapses weeping and refuses to re-engage with reality.\par
\pard Sometimes it\rquote s more subtle. Many dangerous psychopaths get by for months or years without detection. A player who enjoys this kind of challenge may work in tandem with the Game Moderator to keep playing a character with 0 SAN as if things were normal. If you keep all SAN totals secret (see \b OPTIONAL RULE: KEEP SAN SECRET\b0\fs16  \fs22 on page \lang3081 66\lang1033 ), this should not be difficult.\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\i0\f1 Catatonia is complete separation. Your Protagonist\rquote s mind refuses to engage with the world that injured it. Your Protagonist no longer speaks, or eats (without prompting), or looks after him or herself; your Protagonist stares into space in a trance. Some catatonics go so deep they no longer react to physical pain. Others rise in and out of consciousness.\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\i0\f1 Your Protagonist is raving, incapable of holding a conversation that does not stray into insanity.

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\i0\f1 This goes beyond ordinary sociopathy. At 0 SAN, empathy has been burned out of your Protagonist. The feelings and needs of others cannot touch him or her. People are mere objects for his or her amusement or use. Your Protagonist sometimes engages in appallingly merciless actions for gratification. Some psychopaths with 0 SAN appear fine; they are no longer emotionally functional or concerned with people on a human scale, but they keep a simulated veneer of civility.

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 People can become hardened to traumatic stimuli. What sends one Protagonist fleeing may seem mundane to an individual who has survived it often enough. Adaptation to Violence or to Helplessness means you always succeed at a Sanity roll for that type of trauma.\par
Adaptation to Violence or adaptation to Helplessness occurs after your Protagonist has lost SAN from that kind of trauma three times in a row \i without\i0  going temporarily insane from it or hitting the Breaking Point. The character sheet has spaces to mark your Protagonist\rquote s progress toward adaptation. Each time Violence or Helplessness reduces your Protagonist\rquote s SAN by 1 or more, mark a box on your character sheet to keep track of it. \par
If your Protagonist suffers insanity from Violence \i before\i0  all three boxes are marked, erase all the \ldblquote Violence\rdblquote  boxes and start again. If your Protagonist suffers insanity from Helplessness before all three boxes are marked, erase all the \ldblquote Helplessness\rdblquote  boxes and start again. If you fill in all three boxes for Violence or all three for Helplessness, your Protagonist becomes adapted to that type of stressor.\par
\b ADAPTING TO VIOLENCE:\b0  Unfortunately, being adapted to Violence means your Protagonist\rquote s empathy suffers. He or she permanently loses 1D6 CHA and the same amount from each Bond (Individual and Community).\par
\b ADAPTING TO HELPLESSNESS:\b0  Being adapted to Helplessness means your Protagonist\rquote s personal drive suffers. As soon as your Protagonist becomes adapted to Helplessness, he or she permanently loses 1D6 POW.\par
\b ADAPTING TO THE UNNATURAL:\b0  There is no adapting to the unnatural. Things that exist beyond human comprehension are beyond \lquote getting used to.\rquote  Every new encounter is a fresh shock. The only way to \lquote adapt\rquote  to the Unnatural is to reach 0 SAN, whereupon the horrors of the Cthulhu Mythos make perfect sense and no longer inflict mental damage.\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 When your Protagonist loses SAN, you may spend WP to reduce the loss. The amount is always 1D4: roll the die and reduce your WP by that much. \par

Now reduce one of your Protagonist\rquote s Bond scores by the \b same\b0  amount. It could be an Individual Bond or a Community Bond. The next time your Protagonist interacts with the subject of the Bond, decide what shape the projection takes. Does the Protagonist grow hostile and angry, irrationally blaming his or her loved one for imagined wrongs? Does the Protagonist abandon his community in favor of relationships with less importance and meaning? The stresses faced by Protagonists often wreck the families, friendships and associations that give them strength.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 7.9.3\tab Using Bonds to Repress Insanity\par
\pard\sa120\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 Sometimes it\rquote s easier to cope with mental trauma if you pull strength and motivation from the relationships that give life meaning. You may attempt to repress the blind panic of temporary insanity or an acute episode of a disorder by spending Willpower Points. The amount is always 1D4: roll the die and reduce your WP by that much.\par
If your Protagonist still has at least 1 WP after spending the 1D4, describe how a Bond might help your Protagonist keep it together and reduce the Bond by the same amount. \par
Now attempt a SAN roll. If it succeeds, your Protagonist suppresses the insanity or disorder and behaves normally. If it fails, the attempt to repress the effects did not succeed \endash  they occur as normal, despite the points of WP and Bond strength sacrificed in the attempt.\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1 Either way, make a note to describe later how the Bond has strained because your Protagonist has taken so much support from it.\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 There are a few ways to restore mental health. These are described below.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 7.10.1\tab Defeating Unnatural Creatures\par
\pard\sa120\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 The Unnatural in \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0  represents such an affront to the human mind that gaining any control over it is a sort of victory. At the Game Moderator\rquote s discretion, any destruction of a Cthulhu Mythos infiltration by a Protagonist can restore hope \emdash  and in the process, SAN.\par
As a rule, destroying an unnatural creature or an object known to contain otherworldly power restores an amount of SAN equivalent to the lowest amount that could be lost for encountering it.\par
If the SAN loss is 1/1D6, for example, destroying it restores 1 SAN. If the SAN loss is 1D6/1D20, your Protagonist gains 1D6 SAN for destroying it.\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1 This can mean your Protagonist gains more SAN from overcoming the threat than he or she actually lost from facing it. But it can never bring SAN higher than the \b Maximum SAN\b0  score: i.e., 99 minus your Protagonist\rquote s rating in the Unnatural skill.\par
Each Protagonist who was directly involved in putting the threat down gains this SAN increase.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 7.10.2\tab Concluding a Dangerous Adventure\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 Once a deadly adventure has been successfully brought to a close, all Protagonists left alive can breathe a sigh of relief that \endash  for now at least \endash  the world is a safer place. The Game Moderator is justified in awarding such Protagonists a small increase in SAN (and published scenarios may include specific SAN rewards associated with different levels of success). Such gains can never push the Protagonist\rquote s current SAN any higher than \b Maximum SAN\b0  (99 \endash  Unnatural).\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 7.10.3\tab Destroying Accounts of the Unnatural\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 To a Protagonist whose sanity has been blasted by revelations about the horrors of the Unnatural, the fact that accounts exist which lay bare such secrets is disturbing. It is via such dire accounts \endash  \lang3081 ancient tomes, journals or miscellaneous manuscripts\lang1033  \endash  that the madness spreads. Accordingly, some who have lost sanity from unnatural Mythos encounters make it their mission to track down such records and destroy them. What better way to protect humanity than rid it of these dangerous traps? This, in part, explains why true permanent accounts of the Unnatural are so rare.\par
\pard Protagonists who have experienced the Unnatural and who \i deliberately\i0  destroy a permanent record of secret information can earn a small boost to SAN, at the discretion of the Game Moderator. To qualify, the item in question must contain an actual authentic account of the Mythos (see page \lang3081 81\lang1033 ) and the Protagonist\rquote s actions must be deliberate, willful, and cause its permanent and total destruction. The Protagonist must also believe in the veracity of the account. \par
The amount of SAN increase depends upon the how many Mythos secrets the account reveals \endash  this is measured by the Unnatural skill point gain associated with reading/viewing the account.\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 If your Protagonist focuses on day-to-day obligations and relationships, describe something the Protagonist is doing to support an Individual Bond. Roll a SAN test. Success improves the Individual Bond by 1D6 (up to your Protagonist\rquote s CHA); a critical success also adds 1 SAN (up to your \b Recovery SAN\b0 ). Failure adds 1 to the Bond. A fumble means some disastrous conflict reduces the Individual Bond by 1D4 and your SAN by 1.

\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 8.2.2\tab Reorganizing and Replenishing Personal Resources\par
\pard\cf0\b0\f1 As described in \b\caps Replenishing Resources, Removing Checkmarks\b0\caps0  (page \lang3081 23\lang1033 ), if your Protagonist actively drew from his or her personal pool of Resources during an adventure, there will be check marks on the character sheet to record this. By investing some downtime (half a day or more) to reorganize or replenish your stash of resources, all such checks marks can be erased. Describe the lengths your Protagonist goes to tidy up or restock.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 8.2.3\tab Gaining Favor of the Community at Large\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 Your Protagonist may choose to spend time attempting to improve his or her status within a group or society, as represented by a Community Bond he or she \b\i already has\b0\i0 . This may involve influencing key individuals to build a support-base or working hard to solve the community\rquote s problems and earn their respect. \par
A major investment of time warrants a SAN test \endash  success means that your Protagonist\rquote s actions have drawn the attention of key people in the community. A fumbled SAN roll means that some terrible error of judgement by your Protagonist creates a negative reaction: this reduces the bond value by -1D3 and causes a loss of 1 point of SAN.\par
If the SAN roll succeeded, there is a chance that the positive attention from the community may convert into an increase in status. Make a second D100 roll and compare it to current \b Community Bond rating\'d75\b0 . If the roll is \i higher\i0  than the target, the Community Bond value improves:\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 Your Protagonist can spend time in contemplative seclusion, minimizing stress, distractions, and obligations. This isn\rquote t a holiday; it\rquote s extended time alone, or mostly alone, in an environment that\rquote s physically active but places few other demands on the Protagonist. This reduces one Bond (either Individual or Community) by 1 as you let other responsibilities lapse. Roll a SAN test. Success adds 1D4 SAN, or 4 for a critical (up to your \b Recovery SAN\b0 ). Failure adds 1 SAN. A fumble costs 1D4 SAN. Describe the impact of this time alone.\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 Your Protagonist may attempt to create a new Individual Bond with a character. This is not done lightly. It means this new character is developing into an essential, important part of your Protagonist\rquote s life. Attempt a \b CHA\'d75\b0  test. Success establishes a new Individual Bond with a score equal to half your Protagonist\rquote s CHA (round up).

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 Your Protagonist attempts to establish membership in a new community and assert some kind of status within its \lquote pecking order\rquote . You might do this because you have just arrived in a new place, or because you wish to take on a position of standing within a group (e.g., an elite order) that provides social benefits. Getting accepted to a position of trust within a community is not easy. Attempt a \b CHA\'d75\b0  test. Success establishes a new Community Bond with a score equal to \b half\b0  your Protagonist\rquote s Permanent Resources rating (round up).

\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 8.2.7\tab Get Help With Mental Illnesses\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 Depending on where and when your game is set, Protagonists may have the option of accessing professional mental health services to try to overcome the ill-effects accrued through traumatic experiences. Prior to the mid-20th Century, such services were very primitive and arguably more damaging to sanity than curative. The GM will be the final arbiter as to whether reliable and high-quality psychotherapy services are available. However, even in settings where no such facilities exist there are still ways to get help in more old-fashioned ways.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s4\sb40\sl276\slmult1\cf1\i\f0 Therapy\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\i0\f1 If your Protagonist chooses to enlist a clinical therapist to deal with his or her psychological damage, he or she is committing to an ongoing process requiring honesty and commitment. \par
Your Protagonist must decide whether to truthfully tell the therapist what caused the SAN loss. \par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f2\'b7\tab\f1 If your Protagonist tells the truth, there are risks. If the SAN loss came from confronting the Cthulhu Mythos, your therapist might diagnose your Protagonist as suffering from schizophrenia. Alternatively, if the therapist \i believes\i0  your Protagonist\rquote s account, he or she may in turn lose SAN from the shocking details they reveal. \par
\pard\li720\sa200\sl276\slmult1 The outcomes of therapy are determined by a roll against the therapist\rquote s \b Psychoanalyze\b0  skill. If your Protagonist described unnatural events and the therapist thinks they\rquote re delusions, that skill is halved. If the roll fumbles, your Protagonist loses 1 SAN. If it succeeds, your Protagonist regains 1D6 SAN (or 6 with a critical success), up to his or her \b Recovery SAN\b0 .\par
If your Protagonist shares tales of terrible, illegal violence and it sounds like further violence is imminent, the therapist may report it to the authorities. Whether that happens is entirely up to the GM.\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f2\'b7\tab\f1 If, on the other hand, your Protagonist \i doesn\rquote t\i0  tell the therapist the truth, healing is limited. Make a roll against the therapist\rquote s \b Psychoanalyze\b0  skill. If it fumbles, your Protagonist loses 1 SAN. If it succeeds, your Protagonist regains 1D4 SAN (or 4 for a critical success), up to his or her \b Recovery SAN\b0 .\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1 If your Protagonist suffers from a disorder, a critical success with the therapist\rquote s roll cures it (whether your Protagonist told the truth or not). Your Protagonist also develops a Bond with the therapist equal to half your Protagonist\rquote s CHA (or add 1D4 to it if your Protagonist already has that Bond, up to the Protagonist\rquote s CHA). He or she also loses points from another bond of your choice (1D4 from one individual Bond or 1 from a Community Bond). Write a note saying \ldblquote cured\rdblquote  next to the disorder on the character sheet \emdash  but do not erase it. The next time you gain a disorder, you must roll another SAN test. If that fails, the \ldblquote cured\rdblquote  disorder returns in full force alongside the new one.\par
Regardless of whether the rolls result in improvements, the long hours spent with an empathetic person reduces one Bond (either Individual or Community) by 1 as you let other responsibilities lapse.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s4\sb40\sl276\slmult1\cf1\i\f0 Talking it Out\par
\pard\sa120\sl276\slmult1\cf0\i0\f1 Even if no clinical psychotherapy is available to your Protagonist, there is still the time-honored method of healing a damaged mind through sharing one\rquote s burden with an empathic person who one knows and trusts. This other person might be a spiritual adviser, a folk-psychiatrists, or just a kind-hearted fellow member of the community that is willing to reassure you.\par
Being helped through the process of recovering from mental trauma works in a similar way to therapy although takes a lot longer and has less certain outcomes. As with therapy there are risks to sharing detailed accounts of the events that caused the original SAN loss, both to the empathic person (who could take SAN from the account) and to the Protagonist (if the other individual alerts others).\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f2\'b7\tab\f1 As with formal therapy, the effectiveness of folk remedies is determined through skill rolls against the \b Psychoanalyze\b0  skill (or an alternate skill substituted by the GM as fits the game\rquote s setting). The difference is that for any benefit to be achieved, the empathic person must succeed in two consecutive rolls.\par
\pard\fi-357\li714\sa60\sl276\slmult1\f2\'b7\tab\f1 If the Protagonist has not been truthful in relating their story, they can still gain some benefit: a pair of consecutive successful rolls will give them 1D2 SAN back (2 with a critical success), up to his or her POW \'d7 5. If the Protagonist was truthful, the reward is 1D3 SAN (3 with a critical success), to the same maximum.\par
\pard\sa120\sl276\slmult1 For a Protagonist to have a disorder cured through folk remedies, the empathic listener must get two consecutive critical successes on their rolls. If that occurs, it functions in the same way to a therapist making a critical success. \par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1 As with therapists, the hours spent with the empathic listener has the inevitable impact that one other bond (either Individual or Community) is reduced by 1 as you let responsibilities lapse. If the long conversations led to a disorder being cured, you will automatically develop or strengthen an Individual Bond with the empathic listener as noted above for successful therapy outcomes \endash  but at the cost of another bond becoming weaker.\lang3081\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb120\sl276\slmult1\cf2\lang1033\b\f0 8.2.8\tab Improve a Skill or Stat\par
\pard\sa120\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 By training or studying extensively, your Protagonist can try to boost a stat or a skill. This reduces one Bond (either Individual or Community) by 1 as you let other responsibilities lapse. \par
Describe what your Protagonist is doing to improve the stat or skill: \lang3081 poring over crumbling books for INT or a skill, lifting weights for STR, meditating to strengthen self-discipline for POW, loitering in a club or attending a leadership institute for CHA, working with one's personal physician to regain stat points permanently lost from an injury, etc.\lang1033  \par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 This section consists of a series of resources which are designed to help a Game Moderator design exciting and dangerous scenarios to challenge a Protagonist Group. \par
\pard\keep\keepn\s1\fi-432\li432\sb480\sl276\slmult1\cf1\b\f0\fs28 9.0\tab Maddening Revelations\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 A common feature of Cthulhu Mythos fiction is the existence of musty old tomes which describe the \lquote truth\rquote  about mankind\rquote s perilous place in the universe, and the powers thirsting for cosmic upheaval. In the \lang3081 Jazz Age\lang1033  such revelations might be found buried in \lang3081 ancient tomes, journals or miscellaneous manuscripts\lang1033 . Alternatively, the secret knowledge might be passed down from generation-to-generation through spoken tales and mystic traditions.\par
Revelatory accounts and the secret information they contain can, if you wish, be important parts of your \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0  game. Some of the revelations might describe supernatural powers or \ldblquote magickal effects\rdblquote  that Protagonists might be able to utilize to fight back the shadows. Often these will require they perform time-consuming rituals drawn from mystical traditions.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s2\fi-576\li576\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0\fs26 9.1\tab Researching the Mythos\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 If you as Game Moderator want to include a form of revelatory information in your game, there are a few factors to consider:\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f2\'b7\tab\f1 How will the Protagonist\rquote s locate it?\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 What skill rolls are needed to read it (or view it, or otherwise access its information)?\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 How long does it take to study the information before it is understood?\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 Does the information cause a Sanity Loss to those who learn it?\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 Does understanding the revelations cause an increase in skills?\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 Does it impart some other benefit, such as the chance to learn a magickal ritual?\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1 Mythos accounts offer one of the few ways in which Protagonists may increase their rating in the \b Unnatural\b0  skill. Each has an associated amount of Unnatural skill gain that it might potentially impart \'85 if only the Protagonist is able to see past its disordered jumble of insane ideas. Simple accounts of the Cthulhu Mythos might impart just a few points (+1 to +3 perhaps) while weighty records (like those immortalized in the infamous \i Necronomicon\i0 ) might offer the reader thorough and dangerous insight (+15 or more points of increase in \b Unnatural\b0 ).\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 9.1.1\tab Finding Information\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 If the \lquote tome\rquote  (or other information source) is hidden away or stored as part of a vast collection, Protagonists may need to exercise a range of skills to track it down. Or maybe interpersonal skills will allow them to get directions to it from people who are knowledgeable about the collection?\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 9.1.2\tab Accessing and Understanding the Contents\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 If the item is expressed in a language other than the common vernacular, understanding it might require a relevant \lang3081\b Foreign Language\lang1033  \b0 test. This is especially true if the information is expressed in archaic or highly specialized language.\par
Other possibilities:\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sa200\sl276\slmult1\lang1024\f2\'b7\tab\lang3081\f1 If the knowledge locked up in the account is highly contextualized on esoteric systems of thought it might also require an \b Occult\b0  test. \par
\lang1024\f2\'b7\tab\lang3081\f1 If it is so full of references back to antiquated knowledge that it can\rquote t readily be understood, perhaps a \b History\b0  or \b Anthropology\b0  test might be required. \par
\lang1024\f2\'b7\tab\lang3081\f1 On the other hand, if the knowledge is closely tied to people, places, folklore and events from a particular geography then maybe a relevant \b Regional Lore\b0  test may be needed.\par
\lang1024\f2\'b7\tab\lang3081\f1 If the information is written using a cipher a \b Science (Codes and Ciphers)\b0  test might be called for, or perhaps a roll against a relevant \b Military Training\b0  specialialization.\lang1033\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 9.1.3\tab Immersion\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 To the layperson, an account of the Cthulhu Mythos looks like nothing more than a random collection of disjointed thoughts, none of them imparting any real meaning. This is because most people have no prior experience of the Unnatural and thus have no reason to think that the gibbering ravings might be something meaningful.\par
If the Protagonist undertaking the research has an \b Unnatural\b0  skill rating of 0, he or she will be likewise unconvinced. Such an individual will be unable to become sufficiently \lquote immersed\rquote  in the account\rquote s buried secrets to learn anything useful at all.\par
On the other hand, a researcher with skill in \b Unnatural\b0  may be able to see beyond the disconnected rantings and perceive the implied secrets. This requires an \b Immersion test:\b0  a roll against the Protagonist\rquote s current \ul Unnatural skill \'d7 10\ulnone  with a negative modifier based on the account\rquote s weightiness (measured by the amount of potential additional Unnatural skill it may afford the cautious reader). \par

If this roll fails, the researcher becomes convinced that the account is gibberish. No matter how many days or weeks he or she invests in studying it, that belief will prevent any deeper understanding of its contents.\par
If this roll is a \i critical success\i0 , the researcher becomes obsessed with the account \endash  and will want to pursue its analysis at all costs. This might present some difficult situations, but also means the research (see below) will be completed in \b half\b0  the normal time.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 9.1.4\tab Investing Time\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 Delving into a weighty account of the Mythos might take months, especially if it is rendered in rambling and confusing language; on the other hand, the information might be presented in a form that only takes a few minutes to comprehend. You as Game Moderator should make a call as to the amount of time that a Protagonist must invest in order to properly appreciate the contents of the knowledge source \endash  in general, the more cryptic and voluminous, the longer it will take. Conceivably, some records featuring elliptical logic might take months to properly understand.\par
If the Game Moderator determines that some form of skill test is required to comprehend the information (e.g., if it is in a foreign language or recorded in a highly unorthodox way), that roll should only be allowed \i after\i0  the necessary research time has been invested. In general, it isn\rquote t necessary for the research process to be uninterrupted, but a long break might prove a setback which lengthens the overall task.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 9.1.5\tab Dangers of Understanding\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 Lovecraft famously wrote that the most merciful thing in the world is mankind\rquote s inability to correlate all the pieces of knowledge at its disposal. It\rquote s this \ldblquote island of ignorance\rdblquote  that saves humanity from going insane from the realization of the true horrors underlying the world. Deliberately diving into the study of the hidden truth is a potentially perilous undertaking.\par
Revelations about terrible or shocking events or disgusting practices of Cthulhu Mythos entities or their followers, might warrant a \b SAN\b0  Loss.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 9.1.6\tab Skill Increases\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 The main reason to unlock the hidden wisdom of Mythos accounts or other obscure knowledge-sources is to gain information that is relevant to the state of the current world or the scenario/campaign that is being played. In this regard, you as Game Moderator should reward successful research with some helpful details or facts which will aid in solving a problem or remaining alive in the broken world.\par
In addition to this, you might rule that the knowledge learned through research increases the Protagonist\rquote s skill ratings in some way. The most common \lquote reward\rquote  is an improvement to the \b Unnatural\b0  skill (which captures hidden knowledge about the Cthulhu Mythos and its attendant horrors). \par
A minor account might provide +5 skill points (or fewer) to Unnatural, while certain rare and shocking accounts might offer as much as +15. \par
When improving the Unnatural skill, don\rquote t forget that a Protagonist\rquote s Sanity cannot ever be higher than (99 minus the Unnatural skill rating). If changing this cap means current Sanity is too high, that number must also be reduced to match the new Maximum SAN.\par
In addition to learning about the Unnatural, successful research might improve other knowledge-based skills as well. For example:\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sa200\sl276\slmult1\lang1024\f2\'b7\tab\lang3081\f1 Information about obscure human beliefs might improve \b Occult\b0\par
\lang1024\f2\'b7\tab\lang3081\f1 Information about events or places from the distant past might improve \b History\b0  or \b Archeology\b0\par
\lang1024\f2\'b7\tab\lang3081\f1 Information about folklore specific to a geography might improve a \b Regional Lore\b0  skill\par
\lang1024\f2\'b7\tab\lang3081\f1 Information about human civilizations, either past or present might improve \b Anthropology\b0\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1 More mundane knowledge might be learned as well, which improves Art, Craft, First Aid, Law, etc.\lang1033\par
Usually the amount of skill gained through such means will be variable and relatively small (e.g., 1D4 to 1D10).\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 9.1.7\tab Learning Rituals\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 Mythos accounts may also include descriptions of rituals which, if correctly performed, can create a supernatural effect. Rituals typically involve (potentially complex) patterns of action, chants, and associated paraphernalia. The manifestations created through rituals can be significant, but unlike magic in most tabletop roleplaying games such supernatural workings are laborious. They are typically time-consuming and may require the coordinated actions of a group of people to have any chance of succeeding. \par
Despite such inherent limitations, supernatural rituals represent perhaps the most powerful source of otherworldly influence which Protagonists (or their human adversaries) are ever likely to have under their control. As such there are some individuals who scour the world searching for tomes which can instruct them in such rituals. \par
When a Protagonist has successfully read a tome in its entirety you as Game Moderator should provide him or her with a list of any rituals it contains. Not every account contains rituals, and not every description of supernatural effects in an account is detailed enough to allow it to be reproduced. But for those that are present in such form, you should provide a sketchy description of what the ritual seems designed to do. This should be a description in vague game-world terms rather than in terms of game mechanics: \ldblquote seems designed to bring forth a shadow entity\rdblquote  is preferable to \ldblquote summons a Night-Gaunt\rdblquote .\par
A Protagonist might decide to attempt to study the specifics of a ritual described in a tome. If so, he or she will need to devote time and effort to that endeavor. This is \i in addition to\i0  the time spent researching the account itself and represents study that can only begin when its information has been consumed in full.\par
Exactly how much time is needed to study a given ritual depends on its complexity \endash  that is, whether it is considered \b Simple\b0 , \b Complex\b0 , or \b Elaborate. \b0 Typically, the more powerful the potential effects of a ritual, the more complex it will be.\par
\b Simple\b0  rituals take research of the order of \i hours or days\i0  to learn; \b Complex\b0  rituals can only be learned through the application of \i days or weeks\i0  of study; and \b Elaborate\b0  rituals can take \i weeks, months, or years\i0  to master. The time investment to learn a ritual does not have to be a single continuous block of research but can be split across many shorter periods of intense study.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s4\sb40\sl276\slmult1\cf1\i\f0 Rolling to Learn A Ritual\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\i0\f1 If the Protagonist invests the requisite time, he or she will still need to make a roll at the end of the period to see whether the time invested paid off. The Protagonist must attempt a \b SAN\b0  roll \endash  and \i fail\i0  the roll \endash  to learn the ritual. \par
If the roll \b does not\b0  indicate a successful learning of the ritual, it means the Protagonist does not grasp the nuances required to master it. He or she can try again but will need to start from the beginning and again invest the same amount of time again before re-attempting the test. \par
If, on the other hand, the roll \b does\b0  indicate the Protagonist learned the ritual, he or she loses SAN. This is the price of internalizing unnatural truths about the universe and weird techniques for manipulating it. For \b Simple\b0  rituals, the Sanity loss should be modest (e.g., 1 point, 1D4, or 1D6); for \b Complex\b0  rituals a more substantial loss is warranted (e.g., 1D6, 1D8, or 1D10), while learning \b Elaborate\b0  rituals will always be damaging to Sanity (e.g., 1D10, 1D12, or 1D20 point loss). Learning an Elaborate ritual \i also\i0  grants a Protagonist +1 percentile in the \b Unnatural\b0  skill.\par
Once a ritual has been successfully learned, the Protagonist may attempt to perform it (see below).\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s4\sb40\sl276\slmult1\cf1\i\f0 Mythos Accounts With Multiple Rituals\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\i0\f1 Some written accounts, in particular so-called \lquote grimoires\rquote , contain descriptions of many different supernatural rituals. Learning rituals from such sources requires each effort to be attempted separately, using the method described above.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s4\sb40\sl276\slmult1\cf1\i\f0 Keeping Failed Rolls Secret\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\i0\f1 The Game Moderator may choose to keep the SAN roll made at the conclusion of a research attempt secret from the player. If the outcome is a clear success or failure the Protagonist should recognize it as such, but if the roll was a marginal success or failure the Game Moderator might choose to tell the player that the Protagonist \i believes\i0  he or she has memorized all the subtleties but is not 100% sure. The only way to know for certain is to attempt the ritual \endash  and if the learning attempt was a failure, such an attempt will never properly succeed. Although it may still generate an unintended supernatural effect.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s2\fi-576\li576\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0\fs26 9.2\tab Performing Rituals\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 The specific actions, chants, and paraphernalia required to successfully perform a ritual are particular to each and should be designed as part of the ritual\rquote s description.\par
Any attempt to carry out a ritual without the necessary knowledge or components is doomed to failure \'85 although it is possible that flawed ritual activities might still generate some kind of supernatural effect, just not the one intended by the person conducting the ritual. The Game Moderator should use his or her judgement to determine any such random supernatural side-effects; they should almost always be dangerous and detrimental to those involved.\par
In terms of game mechanics, the successful performance of a ritual (once the correct pieces are in place) is achieved via an investment of time/effort, the sacrifice of points in one or more game attribute (usually Willpower Points), and a successful Ritual Activation Test (see below). If all these steps are successfully achieved, the supernatural effects of the ritual will manifest.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 9.2.1\tab Time Invested in the Ritual\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 The amount of time required to perform a ritual depends on its complexity rating \endash  \b Simple\b0 , \b Complex\b0 , or \b Elaborate\b0 .\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f2\'b7\tab\b\f1 Simple\b0  rituals are relatively quick to carry out, requiring somewhere between a turn and a minute.\par
\f2\'b7\tab\b\f1 Complex\b0  rituals are more time-consuming, needing somewhere between a few minutes and an hour.\par
\f2\'b7\tab\b\f1 Elaborate\b0  rituals are serious undertakings, consuming anything from a few hours to a day or maybe more.\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1 During the time taken to perform a ritual, assume that all participants are completely occupied (chanting, carrying out prescribed actions, using paraphernalia in particular ways). A short interruption might not destroy the momentum of the ritual but a longer break likely will.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 9.2.2\tab Powering the Ritual\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 The description of a ritual should outline the type and number of personal attribute points that must be sacrificed to provide mental energies that fuel the supernatural effect.\par
The most common form of sacrifice is Willpower Points \endash  to create relatively minor effects might only require 5 or 6 WPs; a substantial effect might require 15; a vastly powerful effect might require 30; and a truly cosmic-level effect might need 100 or more WPs. \par
\pard When a Protagonist makes a deliberate sacrifice of WPs, check to see whether the new total carries any effect upon him or her (see \b WILLPOWER POINTS\b0 , page \lang3081 42\lang1033 ). In particular, remember that reaching a WP total of 1 or 2 indicates a mental collapse of some kind, and reaching 0 WP causes unconsciousness.\par
Whenever a sacrifice of WP is called for, a participant in the ritual may always choose to sacrifice points of permanent POW instead \endash  each such point is equivalent to 10 WPs for the purposes of fueling a ritual. Such sacrificed points do not refresh, but Protagonists can attempt \b DOWNTIME\b0  activities to try to get some back (see page \lang3081 76\lang1033 ) \par
Some rituals also call for a sacrifice of Hit Points, either from the participants or from elsewhere (animal, human, or other living entity). Note that Protagonists who knowingly harm another person, or even cruelly harm or kill an animal are likely to be subject to Sanity loss due to \b VIOLENCE\b0  (see page \lang3081 66\lang1033 ).\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1 Depending on the nature of the specific ritual, it may be possible for several people to cooperate in the performance. For especially large effects this may be the only way to generate enough mental energies. While the leader of the ritual must have learned it in full (using the process described in the previous section), helpers can be instructed through simple notes and rote learning. Each assistant chooses for themselves how many points of attributes they will sacrifice. \par
\pard\keep\keepn\s3\fi-720\li720\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0 9.2.3\tab The Ritual Activation Test\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 If the requisite amount of time has been devoted to the ritual and the necessary number of attribute points sacrificed, the individual leading the performance may make a roll to see if the effort was ultimately successful.\par
Successfully activating a ritual depends on the ritual leader\rquote s Sanity, but success is more likely the \i lower\i0  that number. The \b Ritual Activation Test\b0  is a SAN test that must be \i failed\i0  for the ritual to work as planned. \par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 The simple act of being involved in a supernatural ritual performance is damaging to a character\rquote s Sanity, regardless of whether the ritual was successful or not.\par
If the performance was completed but something went awry (e.g., insufficient mental energy was raised, or the Ritual Activation Test indicated the effort was fruitless), all participants suffer an automatic SAN loss. For rituals intended to create small effects this will be modest, perhaps just 1 SAN point; if attempting a substantial supernatural effect, the loss is 1D4; if attempting a vastly powerful effect it might be 1D6; and for a cosmic effect it might be 1D20.\par
On the other hand, if the ritual succeeded and the supernatural effect is generated it is quite likely that the experience of witnessing something bizarre created by one\rquote s own actions will damage each participants Sanity. The precise losses should reflect the effect that is created, as described by the spell description. As a guideline, a minor supernatural effect might warrant a SAN loss of 1 point, a substantial one might be worth 1D8, a vast effect might lead to a loss of 1D12, and a truly cosmic manifestation might cause a Sanity loss of anything up to 1D100. \par

\pard\intbl\cf0\b0\f1 Supernatural effects in \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0  are unlike the forms of magic that appear in most roleplaying games, especially games set in the fantasy genre. Rather than wielding a flashy fireball into the midst of combat, a ritual magician in \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0  might create a supernatural effect as the result of hours of ritual incantation placing his or her mind into communion with extradimensional horrors.\par
\pard\intbl\sa120 The following general guidelines will help you in depicting magic in a suitably low\u8208?key and creepy fashion:\par
\pard\intbl\fi-357\li714\sa120\f2\'b7\tab\b\f1 Supernatural Effects are seldom flashy:\b0  while some spells might create a spectacular if shocking manifestation of unnatural horror, most work with little or no visible or physical effect. Frequently, people who aim to unleash supernatural effects have no way to tell whether their ritual succeeded or not, until hours, days, or even weeks have passed. And even then, its effects may be subtle changes that most people would never notice.\par
\f2\'b7\tab\b\f1 Supernatural Effects are usually time\u8208?consuming to create:\b0  many supernatural effects require lengthy rituals which are repetitious and wearying to perform. While there are a handful of smaller, casual effects which might be useful in a tactical, fast\u8208?paced situation, most play out far too slowly to help in tactical environments.\par
\f2\'b7\tab\b\f1 Supernatural Effects are \i ALWAYS\i0  dangerous to invoke:\b0  generating a supernatural effect is equivalent to opening one\rquote s mind and essence to the unknowable forces which make up the Cthulhu Mythos. These powers are inherently corrosive to reality as we know it. So, coming into direct mental or physical connection with them always causes some form of lasting damage to the spellcaster, and maybe others as well.\par
\f2\'b7\tab\b\f1 Supernatural Effects are the enemy of Sanity:\b0  Connecting with the forces of the Mythos is inherently dangerous to one\rquote s Sanity. In game terms this manifests as a mandatory sacrifice of SAN; but in narrative terms you should play up the highly disturbing experience of touching an unknown and unknowable extra\u8208?dimensional force whose very existence is anathema to everything that the caster has ever known or experienced. Generating supernatural effects should hurt. Every single time.\cell\row\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s2\fi-576\li576\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0\fs26 10.1\tab Calculating the Scope of the Supernatural Effect\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 The manifestations associated with a supernatural effect can be virtually anything the Game Moderator can imagine. Where such effects require game mechanics, these can be designed on a case-by-case basis.\par
For determining the attribute cost of a ritual, as well as its potential for creating Sanity losses, it is useful to gauge the overall \lquote magnitude of the effect being generated \endash  this is termed the \b scope\b0  of the effect. For convenience, a scale of eight scope ratings (from least to greatest) is shown below, along with a representative Willpower Point cost for fueling effects at each rating.\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1 Lovecraftian settings often incorporate the idea of extra-dimensional locales, whether remote parts of our own universe, realms created by the collective human unconscious mind, or entirely different dimensions. Stories set in such worlds may involve a myriad of different supernatural effects that permit mere mortals to cross the barrier between the normal (ravaged) world and one such outside region.\par
In determining the scope of an effect which allows dimensional traversal, consider the distances involved. Use the range table provided above, re-imagining the range values as referring instead to the distance traversed. \par

\pard\cf0\b0\fs22 Section 2.5 describes a representative selection of Protagonist Archetypes suitable for games set in the \lang3081 Modern Age\lang1033 . While these are varied enough to support a wide range of character types, situations will inevitably arise where none of the pre-defined Archetypes meets the needs of describing a class of Protagonists or NPCs important to the setting.\par
When this happens, the best solution is to simply create a new Archetype \endash  which is fortunately not difficult.\par

\pard\fi-360\li720\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f2\'b7\tab\f1 a suitable \b Name\b0  that embodies a character type befitting the setting;\par

\f2\'b7\tab\f1 a starting \b Number of Bonds\b0  (usually between 2 and 5);\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 a \b Starting Resources\b0  rating (usually between 2 and 5);\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 a set of \b Skills\b0  which have a starting value higher than the usual base rating for the setting.\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1 For the last three items, there is a simple system to \ldblquote balance out\rdblquote  different Archetypes. Each has a budget of 800 points that can be spent as per the table below:\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 Before diving into the specifics of building game-mechanics for your new Archetype concept, it is worth spending some time making sure the idea is built around a clear concept. How is this Archetype going to be different from others already defined for the setting? In what ways is it filling a gap that none of the existing Archetypes can cover? Is the idea too specific to one situation \endash  and could be broadened out to cover a related category of character types? Or is it too abstract, and in need of refinement to bring it back to something that others will intuitively recognize as an appropriate category of characters for this setting? Having a good concept in mind will make everything that follows much easier, so don\rquote t rush your thinking about the core concept.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s2\fi-576\li576\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0\fs26 11.3\tab Step 2 \endash  Picking Recommended Statistics\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 Each Archetype usually has one or two recommended Statistics that should (ideally) be higher-than-average for characters of that Archetype. Picking these is usually a matter of simple extrapolation from your core concept. Is the Archetype largely driven by knowledge? Then maybe INT should be in the list somewhere. Are individuals of the Archetype defined by their abilities to socialize or establish rapport with other people? Then CHA should definitely be in the list somewhere. If the character type is all about exercising sheer brawn, maybe STR is appropriate \'85 or alternatively if they\rquote re all about fine manipulation or skulking in the shadows, perhaps DEX is a suitable choice. There aren\rquote t too many character types which revolve around healthiness and fortitude, but if yours does maybe you could consider adding CON to the list. It\rquote s fine for your archetype to have just a single recommended statistic, or a couple. More than two is unlikely.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s2\fi-576\li576\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0\fs26 11.4\tab Step 3 \endash  Starting Bonds and Starting Resources\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 Each Archetype needs a starting number of Bonds and a starting Resources rating. Of the budget of 800 points, each Bond slot costs 50 and each rating level in Resources costs 50. A starting point for designing an Archetype is to consider a value of 3 starting bonds and 3 starting resources \endash  this reflects an \ldblquote average\rdblquote  situation for characters; tweak this as seems appropriate.\par
If your concept for the new Archetype is something that has a wide network of contacts, the initial number of Bonds could be 4 or even 5. Each additional bond will, however, reduce the budget of points available for elevating skills so having an extensive network comes with a cost. Some Archetypes are inherently loners: for them, having a smaller number of starting Bonds (perhaps only 2) captures that insular nature and leaves some additional points for resources or skills, depending on your concept for the Archetype. Creating an Archetype with fewer than 2 starting Bonds risks forcing characters into being cut-off from the world around them, and is not usually realistic.\par
For a few rare cases, an Archetype might inherently have one bond that is higher than the normal starting value. If your basic concept inherently places the individual in a leadership role (e.g., your Archetype is supposed to be a local religious leader), it\rquote s ok to add a note that says one of the starting bonds will have a rating value of at least 10. This is usually only meaningful for community bonds.\par
Each Archetype also needs a starting Resources value. Think about how many assets the poorest member of the character type might have access to. If they might be a pauper (at least in terms of access to items), maybe consider a low starting Resources score (perhaps a 2, or in extreme cases a 1). On the other hand, if members of the Archetype would typically have ready access to lots of equipment or assets, a value of 4 or 5 might be worth considering. Don\rquote t forget that during the character generation process, it will be possible to sacrifice skill picks to elevate these base ratings, so leaving a rating at a low level doesn\rquote t necessarily mean that every character created using the new Archetype will have a below-average set of items to draw on: it\rquote s only those who choose not to further sacrifice skill picks that will have a small pool of items to draw on. Making the starting Resources value too high will significantly restrict the number of skills that the Archetype will have at an elevated level. (So, while it would be possible to set your Archetype\rquote s starting Resources at an impressive score of 12, that would use up 600 of the 800 points in the budget, leaving nothing much for skill enhancement; so characters of that Archetype would all universally \ldblquote wealthier-than-most\rdblquote  but lacking in any specific skill. This isn\rquote t usually an interesting choice.)\par
Once you\rquote ve decided on the appropriate number of starting Bonds and starting Resources rating, multiply both numbers by 50 and subtract them from the starting budget of 800. Whatever is left is available for spending on skills.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s2\fi-576\li576\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0\fs26 11.5\tab Step 4 \endash  Skills With Elevated Starting Ratings\par
\pard\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 As described on page \lang3081 27\lang1033 , each skill has a base rating which every character has as a starting value, regardless of their Archetype. For skills that are directly related to the main activities of an Archetype, the beginning rating will be higher to reflect specialized training and/or experience gained through undertaking tasks particular to the Archetype. These elevated starting scores are purchased on a 1-for-1 basis, trading 1 point from the Archetype build budget for a +1 bump in one skill, above its base value. So, if the normal base value for \b Search\b0  is 20 and your concept for the Archetype suggests its members should have a Search value beginning at 50, you would spend 30 points (50 minus 20) from the budget to achieve that goal.\par
It is traditional to spend points in blocks of 10 (i.e., 10, 20, 30, etc.) to ensure that the Archetype\rquote s starting skill ratings remain a neat multiple of 10, although ignoring that convention won\rquote t break anything from a game mechanics perspective.\par
When deciding on which skills to elevate for your Archetype, it is best to think about the common types of tasks that members of the Archetype would perform often \ul\i in their professional duties\ulnone\i0 , or things would generally be assumed to be good at. \par
\pard\sa120\sl276\slmult1 It not unusual for an Archetype\rquote s core concept to strongly suggest a half-dozen or so skills which every member of the archetype would excel at, and a larger list of skills which some \endash  but not necessarily all \endash  members would have as a specialty. It is easy to manage this situation by developing two lists:\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f2\'b7\tab\f1 A list of core skills, universally relevant to every member of the Archetype \endash  usually this won\rquote t be more than about six skills; and\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 A list of skills which seem like good contenders to be optional specializations for the Archetype.\par
\pard\sa120\sl276\slmult1 First you can spend most (but not all) of the available points from the budget to increase the starting rating of \i every\i0  skill on the core skill list, remembering:\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f2\'b7\tab\f1 The points cost is the amount you raise the starting value ABOVE the normal base.\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 There\rquote s usually diminishing value in increasing a skill\rquote s starting value above 70 or 80 since success is likely and the points might be better spent on elevating another lower-valued skill instead.\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 It\rquote s not usually beneficial to elevate a core skill by a tiny amount \endash  anything less than a 30-point nudge for a core skill will feel like you\rquote re short-changing an important part of the Archetype concept.\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 No skill under any circumstance can ever be higher than 99%.\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1 Once you\rquote ve got most of the points spent on upgrading the core list, divide whatever\rquote s left into blocks of 30 or 40 points and specify that the Archetype\rquote s skills also include a certain number of picks from your list of optional specializations, with each pick giving that same block-size of elevation to the chosen skill. So, for example, if you were left with 80 points in the budget after core skills had been elevated, you could decide that the Archetype also includes a choice of two skills from your list of possible specializations with each choice elevating the selected skill to a starting value of base plus 40. Alternatively, if there were 90 points left instead you might decide to offer three picks with each offering a 30-point boost over base.\par
If using this structure to provide a level of customization for the Archetype, you should ensure that there\rquote s a good selection of skills to choose from \endash  ideally there should about \i twice\i0  as many options in the list as there are skill picks on offer, to allow plenty of options for diversifying characters. [So, for example, if you\rquote re allowing four picks from the optional specializations list, try to ensure the list has about eight skills to choose from.]\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s1\fi-431\li431\sb240\sl276\slmult1\cf1\b\f0\fs28 12.0\tab Translating Creatures from D100 Games\par
\pard\sa120\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 Game Moderators may find statistics for horrific creatures and supernatural effects in the rules or supplements published for other D100 Lovecraftian horror RPGs. The general-purpose guidelines below give some assistance with converting creature-related statistics for use in \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0 .\par
In most cases, converting horrific creatures found in other D100 games for use in a \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0  game is straightforward. A seven-step process for carrying out such conversions is described below.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s2\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0\fs26 Step 1: Convert Statistics\par
\pard\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 As described on page \lang3081 8\lang1033 , characters and other creatures in \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0  are principally described in terms of six core capabilities: Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Power, and Charisma. These are measured on a scale of approximately 3\emdash 18 for a human being. Most D100 games use a similar set of characteristics although the seventh edition of the world\rquote s oldest Lovecraftian roleplaying game chooses to instead measure a character\rquote s core statistics on a 1\emdash 100 scale.\par
If the creature or character being translated has game statistics for anything other than the previously mentioned seventh edition game, the translation is simple:\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f2\'b7\tab\f1 Strength (sometimes STR) becomes the creature or character\rquote s Strength statistic in \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0 ; \par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 Constitution (CON), Intelligence (INT), Dexterity (DEX), and Power (POW), all become the identically named statistic in \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0 ; and\par
\f2\'b7\tab\f1 If a creature/character has a listed Appearance (APP) rating, that translates to its Charisma (CHA) in \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0 . \par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1 When translating statistics from the aforementioned seventh edition game, the process is effectively the same, but each number is divided by 5 during the translation (e.g., a CON of 65 for a seventh edition creature would translate to a \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0  Constitution statistic of 13).\par
\pard\sa120\sl276\slmult1 If the creature or character has a listed Sanity (SAN) score, that same number becomes their SAN score in \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0 .\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s2\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0\fs26 Step 2: Derive Hit Points and Will Points (and optionally Resources)\par
\pard\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 In \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0  two key game attributes, Hit Points and Will Points, are derived from the core statistics. The formulae for deriving these may be found in the section on creating Protagonists, on page \lang3081 10\lang1033 . Once the core statistics have been translated for the Mythos creature or character, these should be calculated exactly as described in the Protagonist generation process.\par
When translating human characters (as opposed to creatures) it may be important for the Game Moderator to be able to gauge how well-resourced the character is. In that situation, scanning through the list of Archetypes (starting on page \lang3081 11\lang1033 ), the Game Moderator can see which most closely relates to the character\rquote s role \endash  the base Resources attribute score for the character can be assumed to be the same as that Archetype. This can be modified up or down by the Game Moderator to reflect a vision for the character\rquote s material \lquote wealth\rquote .\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s2\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0\fs26 Step 3: Deriving Sanity Loss\par
\pard\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 For games which list explicit sanity losses for witnessing Cthulhu Mythos horrors, those same sanity losses can be applied in \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0 . For games which do not include specific game mechanics for mental stability, use the table on page \lang3081 67\lang1033  to pick an equivalent sanity loss based on how disturbing and/or disgusting a creature is described as being.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s2\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0\fs26 Step 4: Deriving Skills\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 All D100-based games measure skill proficiency of a person or creature on a scale of 0\emdash 100, the same scale used by \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0 . So, any skill scores assigned as part of the game statistics for another game can be carried across without the need for any arithmetic. However, each different game uses its own list of skills, each of them a variant way of carving the broad field of human knowledge and abilities into different categorizations. Thus, in converting game statistics from another RPG to \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0 , it\rquote s necessary to decide which \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0  skill most closely relates to each skill named in the source stat-block.\par
There are four situations that can arise:\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sa200\sl276\slmult1\b 1.\tab Obvious Match:\b0  The skill named in the source stat-block has an obvious counterpart in the \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0  skill list. In this case, simply give the person or creature the corresponding \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0  skill with the same percentile rating assigned to the original skill.\par
\b 2.\tab Multiple Match:\b0  The skill named in the source stat-block has similarities with several different \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0  skills. In this case, you can either pick one of the \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0  skills (ideally the most relevant) and assign all the original skill\rquote s percentile rating to that skill, or you can split up the percentiles among multiple \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0  skills.\par
\b 3.\tab Clash:\b0  Sometimes during the translation of many different skill ratings, it will occur that several different foreign-game skills all translate to the same \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0  skill. In that case, the person or creature\rquote s percentile rating in that skill should be the \b\i highest\b0\i0  of all the different skills that translate to that skill.\par
\b 4.\tab Novelty Skill:\b0  Some games like to include silly or oddly specific skills (like \ldblquote bake cookies\rdblquote  or \ldblquote defuse nuclear bomb\rdblquote ). You can either ignore these skills altogether or carry them across as similar \lquote additional skills\rquote  (i.e., presume the existence of a cookie baking skill in \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0 , whose definition you can make up as needed).\par
\pard References to a rating in the \ldblquote Cthulhu Mythos\rdblquote  skill used in other games should all be carried across to \i Cthulhu Eternal\rquote s\i0  \b Unnatural\b0  skill (see page \lang3081 36\lang1033 ).\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s2\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0\fs26 Step 5: Deriving Attacks\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 Every D100-based game describes the basic attributes of an offensive capability (or attack) in terms of a percentage chance that the attack will hit its target, plus a dice roll to determine the HP damage that the attack inflicts.\par
\pard When converting a stat-block to \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0 , each attack mode will typically map to a similar or equivalent weapon skill with the same percentile rating. Damage ratings (die rolls) can either be carried across unchanged, or if the attack mode obviously relates to one of the weapons listed in the examples on page \lang3081 49\lang1033 , you can just use the \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0  damage rating for the listed weapon. Where the damage die listed in the source stat-block mention adding a \ldblquote Damage Bonus\rdblquote , consult the material on page \lang3081 48\lang1033  to see whether the \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0  attack should also include the equivalent bonus. \par
If converting a stat-block for a creature \endash  especially a large creature, or one with a STR well outside the normal human range \endash  it is probably better to forget about Damage Bonus altogether. Many D100-based games give such massive monstrosities equally massive Damage Bonuses (+3D6 and above): \i Cthulhu Eternal\rquote s\i0  combat system doesn\rquote t seek to model overwhelming damage by means of large pools of dice \endash  instead, it uses the Lethality mechanic. Consider setting the total damage rating of such a creature\rquote s attacks based on its \i overall\i0  damage rating in the source system \endash  that is, the attack\rquote s base damage \i plus\i0  the creature\rquote s stated Damage Bonus. If that total is no-more than 2 dice, then simply set the \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0  damage rating for the attack equal to that.   \par
If the foreign-game attack mode lists more than 2 dice to roll for damage overall, it is likely that it would be better to represent the damage in terms of a Lethality rating. The table below gives some approximate translations:\par

\pard An alternate method of assigning an Armor value for worn protection is to consult the table in \b ARMORED\b0  (page \lang3081 53\lang1033 ), locating a roughly-equivalent type of protective equipment and use the Armor value shown in the table.\par
\pard\keep\keepn\s2\sb200\sl276\slmult1\cf2\b\f0\fs26 Step 7: Defining Special Powers and Defenses\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 Perhaps the hardest part of converting stat-blocks for creatures (and sometimes human beings) to \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0 , is translating special powers and defenses, including unusual modes of attack. These are sometimes written in a manner that is specific to the game-mechanics for the source system.\par
\pard\sa120\sl276\slmult1 There are two basic approaches to converting special powers: \par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sa200\sl276\slmult1 1.\tab finding a similar power already possessed by a creature with \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0  stats, or \par
2.\tab converting the individual game mechanics underlying the power into \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0  concepts piece-by-piece.\par
\pard For determining appropriate \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0  game-statistics to cover special defenses, a good place to start is considering the categories of Defenses described in \b PROTECTION IN COMBAT\b0 , page \lang3081 53\lang1033 . These are: Fragile, Exposed, Armored, Huge, and Transcendent. \par
Furthermore, some creatures have physical forms that are less susceptible to Lethal damage: the box nearby summarizes different levels of protection that the Game Moderator can assign to otherworldly monstrosities.\par

\pard\intbl\sa120\cf0\b0\f1 During a translation the GM might need to invent game statistics for special forms of attacks. The following examples provide some example powers that can be used or adapted as needed.\par
\pard\intbl\sa60\b Blood Drain:\b0  The bite of the entity drains blood from the victim each turn until forcibly detached. For each turn of blood loss, the victim loses 1D6 STR. If STR reaches zero the victim dies, however if he or she survives the attack, it will be slowly regained at the rate determined by the Game Moderator.\par
\b Cling & Bite: \b0 After the entity bites a victim, it will cling to it unless forcibly removed. Each subsequent turn inflicts a further 1D3 Hit Points of damage to the victim.\par
\b Engulf Victims:\b0  If a victim is pulled into the entity\rquote s mass it becomes absorbed within it. An individual trapped inside the entity must separately make an \b opposed test\b0  comparing his or her \b STR\'d75\b0  against the entity\rquote s \b STR\'d75\b0 . If the test is failed, the victim takes Lethal Damage with rating equal to 1% \'d7 the entity\rquote s CON. Trapped targets inside the entity find it difficult to move or attack: only by making a percentile roll below their \b STR\'d75\b0  can such individuals make an attack while inside the entity.\par
\b Mental Drain:\b0  If the entity wishes to mentally weaken those in its proximity, it can compel an individual to perform an \b opposed test\b0  which matches the entity\rquote s \b POW\'d75\b0  versus the victim\rquote s \b INT\'d75\b0 . If the victim is defeated in this test, he or she immediately loses 1D6 Willpower Points + 1D6 SAN. The WPs are added to the attacker\rquote s total.\par
\b Tentacle Constrict/Crush:\b0  If one of the entity\rquote s tentacles successfully strikes an enemy it will wrap around it and continue to crush it in later turns. Unless freed by external means, the victim will continue to suffer Hit Point damage equal to half the normal attack damage in each succeeding turn.\par
\pard\intbl\b Tentacle Grapple:\b0  If the tentacle of the entity strikes a victim it wraps itself around a limb, effectively \b PINNING\b0  the target (see page \lang3081 45\lang1033 ). Being held in this way does not inflict any Hit Point damage but the victim is effectively unable to take any actions until he or she is freed. The entity can use its other attacks against victims held by its tentacle. Breaking free from the entity\rquote s grip requires success in an \b opposed test\b0  pitting the entity\rquote s \b STR\'d75\b0  against the victim\rquote s \b STR\'d75\b0 .\par

\pard\intbl\sa60\cf0\b0\f1 During a translation the GM might need to invent game statistics for special abilities that aren\rquote t attacks but still provide the creature or person with an advantage. The following examples provide a few ideas that can be used or adapted as needed.\par
\b Hypnotize:\b0  The entity\rquote s gaze can render a victim in a trance-like state. When a victim locks eyes with the entity, he or she makes an \b opposed POW\'d75 vs POW\'d75\b0  test with it. If the target loses, a hypnotic state quickly descends. Humans controlled in this way will always follow simple instructions. If the commands are inherently self-destructive or injurious to the controlled person, an \b INT\'d75\b0  roll can be attempted at the beginning of each turn \endash  success means the person snaps out of the trance.\b\fs21\par
Invisible: \b0 The entity has the power to become invisible to normal vision through a supernatural effect; attempts to hit the entity while it is invisible are \i halved\i0 .\b\fs22\par
Mental Control:\b0  The entity has the power to control humans via mental dominance. Resolve such attempts as an \b opposed POW\'d75 vs POW\'d75\b0  test; if the target\rquote s will is overcome, he or she is compelled to remain in close proximity to the area where the mental control was initiated. Once controlled, a dominated human can be mentally contacted by the entity regardless of where it is, anywhere on Earth. This communication costs the entity 1 Willpower Point.\par
\b Regeneration:\b0  Regenerates 2 HP per turn after being wounded; if the entity\rquote s HP ever reach zero it is dead and will not regenerate.\par
\pard\intbl\b Trans\u8208?dimensional Travel:\b0  The entity has an innate ability to travel between different dimensions. Initiating a transition from our dimension to another takes a full (uninterrupted) turn and costs the entity 4 Willpower Points. If the entity is holding anything or anyone (e.g., someone held via a previous pin action), they too make the journey.\b\cell\row\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\b0\par

\b Poisoned by <Substance>: \b0 The entity\rquote s metabolism is particularly susceptible to a common earthly substance. Whenever the entity comes into direct physical contact with the substance it must make a \b CON\'d75\b0  test; if it fails, the entity suffers Lethality 10% damage. \par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\cf0\b0\f1\fs22 Creature stat-blocks in Gumshoe are relatively brief, consisting of ratings for: Athletics, Health, Scuffling, Hit Threshold, Alertness Modifier, Stealth Modifier, Weapon, Armor, and sometimes Stability Loss. The tables below give a (rough) idea of how these ratings can be carried across to \i Cthulhu Eternal\i0  creature statistics. Because Gumshoe is quite a different system, some creativity will be required to fill in statistics like INT, POW, etc. since Gumshoe typically doesn\rquote t measure such attributes for creatures.\par
