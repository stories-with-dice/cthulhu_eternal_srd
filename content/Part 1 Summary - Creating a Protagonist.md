>> How To Create A Protagonist
Determine Harshness of Protagonist’s Upbringing
 Ask Game Moderator for the setting’s Harshness Descriptor – Normal(ish), Harsh, Very Harsh.
Stats & Derived Attributes
 Roll STATISTIC scores (see page 5) or divide 72 points between the six stats. See page 9 for suggested sets.
 Modify STR and/or CON statistic scores based on Harshness:
o Harsh add +1 to STR or CON (player’s choice)
o Very Harsh add +1 to STR and CON
 Calculate DERIVED ATTRIBUTES (see page 10).
o HP = (STR + CON) ÷ 2, rounded up.
o WP = POW.
o Recovery SAN is always POW × 5, regardless of setting harshness.
o Determine Starting SAN based on Harshness Descriptor:
 Normal(ish) SAN = POW × 5.
 Harsh or Very Harsh SAN = POW × 4.
o BP = SAN − POW.
 High and low stat scores can tell something about your Protagonist’s physical description. (See DISTINGUISHING FEATURES on page 9.)
 If STR is below 9 or above 12, look up DAMAGE BONUS (see page 48).
Archetype, Skills, Resources & Bonds
 Choose an ARCHETYPE from the lists starting on page 12.
 Write down the ARCHETYPAL SKILLS for your Protagonist’s Archetype and record the starting RESOURCES rating associated with the Archetype.
 Your Protagonist may get Adversity Skill Points (see page 18) which can be used to increase one of the four setting-specific skills defined as adversity skills. Each pick provides +20 rating to the chosen skill.
o Harsh 1 pick
o Very Harsh 2 picks
 On a piece of scrap paper, record the Protagonist’s number of available BONUS SKILL POINT picks (see below). This starts at 10.
 (Optional) Modify your Protagonist’s RESOURCES rating (see page 18):
o Increase rating by sacrificing one or more BONUS SKILL POINT picks; the first sacrifice gives +5 to RESOURCES rating, each subsequent sacrifice gives +2. 
o Alternatively, choose to reset rating to 0 and receive one extra BONUS SKILL POINT pick.
 Once the final RESOURCES rating has been established, look up the breakdown (see page 20) of “at-hand”/stowed/stored points and number of Resource checkmarks and copy these to Protagonist sheet
 Define your Protagonist’s BONDS (see page 23).
o The Protagonist’s Archetype determines how many Bonds he or she has.
o Each Bond is either a Community Bond or an Individual Bond (player’s choice).
o Each Individual Bond refers to an individual with special significance and begins with a score equal to your Protagonist’s CHA.
o Each Community Bond refers to a community within which the Protagonist has a particular standing and begins with a value equal to half his or her RESOURCES rating (see above).
o (Optional) Modify Community Bond Values:
 Improve the rating of any Community Bond by sacrificing BONUS SKILL picks; the first sacrifice for any given Bond gives +5 to its value, each subsequent sacrifice for the same Bond gives +2.
 Alternatively, choose to take a rating of 1 for a Community Bond (reflecting the lowest possible standing in the society) and receive one extra BONUS SKILL POINT pick.
 After resolving any optional spends of BONUS SKILL POINTS (page 27) for non-skill benefits, use the remainder to improve ANY skills (except Unnatural). Each pick provides an increase of 20 points.
o No skill can start higher than 80%
Mental Damage from Harsh Environment
 If Setting Harshness is anything other than “Normal(ish)”, determine any MENTAL DAMAGE FROM ENVIRONMENT (see page 36). This may mean:
o Protagonist begins play with MENTAL DISORDERS.
o Protagonist loses points from Bonds due to emotional distance.
o Protagonist begins play ADAPTED to Violence or Helplessness.
Final Details
 Choose NAME, AGE, SEX, BIRTHPLACE and Current HOME.
 As you play, describe up to five MOTIVATIONS that are not Bonds.
 When your Protagonist develops a new MENTAL DISORDER, it replaces a motivation.
