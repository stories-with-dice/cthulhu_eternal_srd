# Equipment

Most equipment that your Protagonist will buy, find or use does not require any special rules – if you have the equipment, and it is in working order then you can use it (possibly with a skill or stat test) to do things. Some items that are poorly made or worn-out may incur a penalty (see the box nearby).

Obtaining equipment can be as simple as purchasing it in a store (assuming such commerce exists in the game setting); alternatively, it can involve scrounging around trying to piece together usable items from junk.

## Buying Equipment

The table below gives some indicative prices for equipment. It also shows the normal range of available financial wealth that is typical for individuals at different strata of society (as defined by the Permanent Resources rating, see **Detailed Description: Resources**, page 18).

#### Future Age

**Rating and What the Rating Represents**

- 0 No ownership of any item of value or function. Penury. Near starvation.
- 1-4 Owns only basic and valueless items; barely enough to eke out a basic life. Always hungry.
- 5-8 Owns a sparse collection of valuable or useful items, some in terrible condition. Sometimes hungry.
- 9-12 Owns a modest cache of valuable, useful items. Usually has basic food.
- 13-16 Owns a fair stock of low-grade valuable items. Occasional access to superior food.
- 17-18 Owns an impressive collection of useful gear; considered wealthy / well-resourced. Regular access to superior food
- 19 The envy of most people; owns numerous sought-after items of impressive function. Access to the best food and beverages.
- 20+ Access to unparalleled quantities of valuable or useful items. A stockpile of wealth. Choice of any available food, in any quantity.

## Scrounging

Some items that the Protagonists want to obtain might not be easy to obtain – either because they are restricted in some way, especially scarce, or illegal. Alternatively, the items might be available, but priced such that the Protagonist simply can’t afford them. In such situations, the only recourse might be to scrounge around to see if the items can be ‘liberated’ from somewhere. This might involve sifting through discarded items to find pieces that are good enough to function as needed, and perhaps lashing them together to make more complex equipment.

If a Protagonist wants to obtain a resource that isn’t available to them via simple means, there are two ways:

1. By rummaging through the stockpile of belongings that constitute his or her personal ‘resources’, or

2. Searching the environment to try to locate an abandoned or unclaimed supply of that resource.

Each of these methods uses a different game mechanic.

The former is a use of the Protagonist’s **Resources** rating, while the latter is a use of his or her **Search** skill.

In both cases, the difficulty of the test to locate a usable item depends on the scarcity of the item being sought, as well as:

- **For rummaging the resource pool** – whether the item is small enough to realistically be carried around from place to place.
- **For scavenging** whether the location being searched is a likely or unlikely place for such resources to have been stored or abandoned.

The results of a test can indicate that an item has been discovered, or describe utter failure of the search/rummaging. However even if the roll is successful there is no guarantee that the resource discovered will be in good condition – the discovered item might be heavily worn or maybe even utter junk (see box nearby).

| Some of the items which the Protagonist finds aren’t junk but have seen considerable previous use and be heavily worn out.

| If the Protagonist is searching for a type of consumable resource (e.g., water, food) and gains a less-than-perfect outcome, it is possible that some quantity of the resource has been found but in a spoiled condition that may be potentially dangerous to use/ingest.<br><br>  The Game Moderator will need to interpret what this means in the context of the resource type, and whether the spoiling is obvious or requires a skill test to detect.<br><br>  - Ingesting spoiled food or water is treated as an exposure to poison (see **POISON AND DISEASE** on page 57). The default toxicity is (Speed 1D4 hours; Lethality 2%), but the Game Moderator can vary this to fit the situation.<br><br>- Administering spoiled pharmaceuticals can be considered as per food and water (if the original medicine was something relatively minor), or as per the failure of a Pharmacy roll during administration of a dangerous drug (Poison; Speed 1D6 hours; Lethality 5%).<br><br>- Attempting to use other “spoiled” consumables (e.g., gasoline or weapon ammo) usually results in them being inert and useless, although the Game Moderator might decide they result in dangerous situations for the users (explosions, damage to weapons, vehicles, etc.) |

### Resource Categories and Scarcity

As an abstraction, the scarcity of a resource in the game setting can be rated on the following scale (from least to most scarce):

- **Abundant:** The resource is virtually everywhere; the average person probably has at least some of it at any given time.
- **Uncommon:** The resource isn’t something that you’d just stumble upon accidentally but if you put concerted effort into it, you would probably find some.
- **Hard to Get:** The resource is in short supply or is somehow heavily regulated; most people don’t have ready access to it at all but if you have special access or know the right people, you can probably get some.
- **Very Hard to Get:** The resource is absent from all the common places and even people with special access find it a significant challenge to track some down. Don’t be surprised if you can’t get any at all.
- **Impossible to Get:** Stockpiles of this resource simply don’t exist; people that are especially resourceful might have been prudent enough to snare some for their personal supply, but that’s it.

The scarcity rating of a resource affects a Protagonist’s attempt to either scavenge from the environment (using the Search skill) or rummage through their personal “resource stash” to find it. The table below summarizes the effects of scarcity.

## The Fine Art of Jury-Rigging

Protagonists may often find themselves faced with an inability to track down the exact equipment or devices that they really need to get something done. No amount of scrounging or rummaging through each person’s resources pool will track down the obscure item they need. What can a Protagonist group do in that situation? One option is to devise a plan to hunt down a collection of less-scarce component items and cobble together some kind of hodge-podge out of the parts. This is the fine art of jury-rigging.

In _Cthulhu Eternal_, all attempts to build these kinds of lash-ups are governed by **Craft skill specializations or Technology Use (at the GM's discretion)**.

The players should describe exactly what they plan to construct and what components they hope to use. Ideally there should be some kind of logic or rationale behind why such items might come together in the way imagined, but ultimately it is up to you as Game Moderator to decide whether the planned jury-rigged device has any chance of working.

Once the plan is made, choose a scarcity for each component parts – hopefully somewhat better than the scarcity of the original item – and the Protagonists can venture forth (or rummage around their resource pools) to see if they can find all the pieces they need. Once they have each part, one or more skill tests will be needed to successfully assemble the final item or device.

At best, a lash-up created in this way qualities as a ‘heavily worn’ version of the real item or device. If any discovery rolls along the way yielded up sub-standard parts, or the skill rolls were only marginally successful, you might decide the lash-up is barely-functional ‘junk’ (see **PRE-LOVED ITEMS AND SPOILED GOODS** on page 62).
