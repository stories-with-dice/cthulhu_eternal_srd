Depending on the nature of the game setting, different types of simple or sophisticated vehicles might be common items. If the Protagonists or their adversary have access to such vehicles, the following guidelines may assist when dangerous and/or action-oriented scenes involving vehicles arise during play.

Vehicles have three basic statistics:

- **Hit Points** and **Armor**, in case they’re involved in combat, and
- **Speed** ratings that affect chases.

## **6.1 Hit Points and Armor**

Each vehicle counts as a Huge target (see **HUGE**, page 54). It takes damage from unarmed attacks and small weapons such as knives and clubs only when the Game Moderator thinks it makes sense.

A vehicle that loses **half** its Hit Points is badly damaged. It can’t be operated without a relevant skill test (depending on the type of vehicle). The next time such a test _fumbles_, the vehicle fails altogether until repaired. Repairing a damaged vehicle requires time, parts, and successful application of one or more skill tests. Even if repaired, the vehicle might now qualify as ‘heavily worn’ or ‘junk’ (see **Pre-Loved Items and Spoiled Goods**, page 62).

A vehicle that loses _all_ of its Hit Points is demolished. It will never function again.

## **6.2 Speed**

There are two broad categories of vehicle speed: Surface and Air. Any vehicle with an Air Speed rating can automatically outrun a vehicle with a Surface Speed rating (except for Hot Air Balloons, which can’t outrun any vehicle, and Zeppelins which are considered equivalent speed to a Slow Surface vehicle).

Within the same vehicle category, some are faster than others. A vehicle with a ‘Fast’ rating grants a +20% bonus to any **Drive** or **Pilot** test to pursue or escape. A ‘Slow’ vehicle incurs a −20% penalty instead. An ‘Average’ rating confers no modifier.

Jet planes have a speed rating of ‘Special.’ A jet automatically outruns any vehicle except another jet, and a fighter jet outruns any other kind of jet.

A vehicle that’s notorious for poor handling or that’s in bad shape might counts as ‘heavily worn’ or ‘junk’ (see above) at the GM’s discretion.

### **6.2.1 Ramming**

The Game Moderator decides how deadly a collision ought to be. Here are a few suggestions for a vehicle’s ramming damage.

**AT LOW SPEED:** 1D6 or 2D6 damage.

**AT MODERATE SPEED:** roll half the vehicle’s maximum HP as a Lethality rating. A “Slow” vehicle cannot go faster than this.

**AT HIGH SPEED:** roll the vehicle’s maximum HP as a Lethality rating.

If the target is a huge creature or another vehicle, the ramming vehicle suffers half ramming damage based on the target’s HP.

A vehicle’s Armor rating acts as Armor Piercing for its ramming damage.

Every passenger in a ramming vehicle takes 1D6 damage. Every passenger in a rammed vehicle takes 2D6 damage. A worn seat belt or active air bag halves the damage. A passenger in a vehicle that rams a target less than huge size suffers no damage.
